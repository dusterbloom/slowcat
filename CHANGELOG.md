## [2025-08-20] - Resilient Reconnects, Fixed Context Memory, and Noise Guards

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Pipeline
- Robust RTVI handling: supports both `client_ready` and `on_client_ready`, plus `client_disconnected`; adds 2s auto-ready fallback to prevent stalls after fast reconnects.
- Initial context delivery is idempotent and sent once per session (via event or fallback), eliminating ‚Äúsilent‚Äù pipelines.
- Idle timeout is env-configurable (`PIPELINE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`); default disabled to avoid mid-session cancellation.
- GreetingFilter wired into the pipeline to strip verbose LLM introductions and keep replies concise.

### üé§ STT / üîä TTS
- Sherpa OnlineRecognizer (true streaming) with optional punctuation; normalized final transcripts (spaces around punctuation, collapsed repeats).
- Short-final debounce prevents premature replies when punctuation causes early endpoints (`SHERPA_MIN_FINAL_WORDS`, `SHERPA_ENDPOINT_DEBOUNCE_MS`).
- Sensible defaults for endpoint detection (`SHERPA_RULE2_MIN_TRAILING_SILENCE=1.0`).
- Streaming Kokoro TTS preserved; subsecond TTFB warm once initialized.

### üß† Memory & Context (Fixed Budget)
- SmartContextManager replaces unbounded context with a fixed token budget and dynamic allocation.
- Compact system prompt + tone guidance; added Interaction Rules for small models (no verbatim echo, join spelled letters, at most one follow-up, no unsolicited capability lists).
- Previous session summary injected on connect; running summary updates mid-session.
- Relevant Facts strictly structured; Conversation Snippets separated and budgeted.
- Recent-turn pairing tracked; dynamic recent window sized by leftover budget.
- Session metadata always present; session counting corrected with `start_session()` (increments once per session) and `update_session()` (no longer bumps session count).

### üóÇÔ∏è TapeStore & Summaries
- Noise guard enabled by default: persist a turn only if it‚Äôs a question, or has ‚â•3 alpha words, or length ‚â•15 chars (tunable via `TAPE_MIN_USEFUL_WORDS`, `TAPE_MIN_USEFUL_LEN`).
- Disconnect summaries improved: filters boilerplate intros and very low-signal lines for compact orientation on next session.

### üîå LLM Streaming & Response Dedup
- ResponseTap buffers streaming and commits exactly one final assistant message; prevents fragment leaks into context.
- Dedup OpenAI LLM adapter maintained; no streaming-frame pollution of conversation context.

### üîß Configuration Flags & Docs
- New flags documented in AGENTS.md and added to `server/env.example`:
  - Identity/Persistence: `USER_ID`, `FACTS_DB_PATH`, `PIPELINE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS`.
  - Spelling hints (opt-in, generic): `ENABLE_SPELLING_HINTS`, `ENABLE_LOCATION_SPELLING_HINTS`.
  - TapeStore noise thresholds: `TAPE_MIN_USEFUL_WORDS`, `TAPE_MIN_USEFUL_LEN`.
  - STT tuning: `SHERPA_RULE2_MIN_TRAILING_SILENCE`, `SHERPA_MIN_FINAL_WORDS`, `SHERPA_ENDPOINT_DEBOUNCE_MS`.

### ‚ö° Performance & Stability
- Eliminated dead-pipeline scenarios after reconnects via RTVI auto-ready.
- Reduced token usage with compact prompts and separated snippets.
- Suppressed noisy sklearn matmul runtime warnings for cleaner logs.

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed context duplication (no duplicate ‚Äú[Session Info]‚Äù, no double-inserting current user message).
- Prevented assistant fragment accumulation in recent context.
- Corrected session counting (increments once per session).
- Prevented premature finals and punctuation artifacts from triggering mid-thought replies.
