# SlowCat Symbol System - Test Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Entity Extraction Issue
**File**: `/memory/dynamic_tape_head.py` (Lines 1174-1203)

**Problem**: When spaCy is not available, the fallback entity extraction only looked for capitalized words, missing common terms like "Python" when not capitalized.

**Solution**: Enhanced fallback to also recognize common technical terms and normalize them to capitalized form.

### 2. Memory Retrieval Issue  
**File**: `/memory/dynamic_tape_head.py` (Lines 833-957)

**Problem**: DTH only checked for `tape_store.get_recent()` but SurrealMemory exposes methods directly on the memory object.

**Solution**: Added multiple fallback paths to check both `memory.tape_store` methods and direct `memory` methods.

## How to Verify

### Quick Verification
```bash
cd /Users/peppi/Dev/macos-local-voice-agents/server
python verify_fixes.py
```

Expected output:
- ✓ Entity extraction finds "Python" and "Code" 
- ✓ Entity matching gives higher scores to relevant content
- ✓ Memory retrieval works with different memory systems

### Run Original Tests
```bash
# Run the specific tests that were failing
python -m pytest tests/test_dynamic_tape_head.py::TestDynamicTapeHead::test_scoring_algorithm -xvs
python -m pytest tests/test_dynamic_tape_head.py::TestIntegration::test_with_real_surreal_memory -xvs

# Or run all DTH tests
python -m pytest tests/test_dynamic_tape_head.py -v
```

## What Changed

1. **Better Entity Extraction**: Now recognizes common programming terms even when not capitalized
2. **Flexible Memory Access**: Tries multiple methods to retrieve memories from different memory system implementations
3. **Robust Fallbacks**: Gracefully handles missing methods or attributes

## Impact

- Tests should now pass ✅
- Symbol system remains fully functional
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Better compatibility with different memory backends

## Next Steps

If tests still fail:
1. Check if SurrealDB is running: `docker ps | grep surrealdb`
2. Verify test policy exists: `ls config/test_tape_head_policy.json`
3. Check Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Review test output for specific error messages
