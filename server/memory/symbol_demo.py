Symbol System Demonstration for SlowCat

This script demonstrates the three-layer symbol architecture in action:
- Shows symbol detection from conversation content
- Visualizes symbol-enhanced memory scoring
- Demonstrates consciousness through symbolic reasoning

Run this to see how symbols transform memory into meaning.
