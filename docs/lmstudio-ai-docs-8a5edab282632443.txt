# LM Studio Documentation

Content from this repo is served at [lmstudio.ai/docs](https://lmstudio.ai/docs).

## Parsing rules

- Folders under docs/ are treated as sections
- Files under a section folder are treated as articles
- You can nest folders to create sub-sections
- `0_root` is a special folder that contains the root-level articles
- `index.md` is a special file that is treated as the section's landing page (served on `/docs/<section>/`)
- you can control the ordering of sections by naming them with a number prefix (e.g. `1_api`, `2_guides`, etc.)
- you can control the ordering of articles by setting the `index` field in the frontmatter
  - `index: -1` means "place this article at the end of the list"
- files and folders starting with `_` are ignored

## How to add new documentation articles

1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate folder

2. Populate the file with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Keyboard Shortcuts
description: Learn about the keyboard shortcuts in LM Studio
index: 2
---
```

##### Optionally set `sidebar_title:` to override the title in the sidebar

## Custom markdown component

### -> See examples in `_template_dont_edit.md`

### Multi-Language Code Snippets

See it in action on a model page: https://lmstudio.ai/model/deepseek-r1-qwen-7b

###### LM Studio 0.3.19 • 2025‑07‑21

### Bug fixes for streaming and tool calls

- Corrected usage statistics returned by OpenAI‑compatible streaming responses [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.19#:~:text=,OpenAI%20streaming%20responses%20were%20incorrect).
- Improved handling of parallel tool calls via the streaming API [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.19#:~:text=,API%20were%20not%20handled%20correctly).
- Fixed parsing of correct tool calls for certain Mistral models [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.19#:~:text=,Ryzen%20AI%20PRO%20300%20series).

---

###### LM Studio 0.3.18 • 2025‑07‑10

### Streaming options and tool‑calling improvements

- Added support for the `stream_options` object on OpenAI‑compatible endpoints. Setting `stream_options.include_usage` to `true` returns prompt and completion token usage during streaming [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.18#:~:text=%2A%20Added%20support%20for%20%60,to%20support%20more%20prompt%20templates).
- Errors returned from streaming endpoints now follow the correct format expected by OpenAI clients [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.18#:~:text=,with%20proper%20chat%20templates).
- Tool‑calling support added for Mistral v13 tokenizer models, using proper chat templates [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.18#:~:text=,with%20proper%20chat%20templates).
- The `response_format.type` field now accepts `"text"` in chat‑completion requests [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.18#:~:text=,that%20are%20split%20across%20multiple).
- Fixed bugs where parallel tool calls split across multiple chunks were dropped and where root‑level `$defs` in tool definitions were stripped [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.18#:~:text=,being%20stripped%20in%20tool%20definitions).

---

###### LM Studio 0.3.17 • 2025‑06‑25

### Tool‑calling reliability and token‑count updates

- Token counts now include the system prompt and tool definitions [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.17#:~:text=,have%20a%20URL%20in%20the). This makes usage reporting more accurate for both the UI and the API.
- Tool‑call argument tokens are streamed as they are generated [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.17#:~:text=Build%206), improving responsiveness when using streamed function calls.
- Various fixes improve MCP and tool‑calling reliability, including correct handling of tools that omit a `parameters` object and preventing hangs when an MCP server reloads [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.17#:~:text=,tool%20calls%20would%20hang%20indefinitely).

---
###### LM Studio 0.3.16 • 2025‑05‑23

### Model capabilities in `GET /models`

- The OpenAI‑compatible REST API (`/api/v0`) now returns a `capabilities` array in the `GET /models` response. Each model lists its supported capabilities (e.g. `"tool_use"`) [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.16#:~:text=,response) so clients can programmatically discover tool‑enabled models.
- Fixed a streaming bug where an empty function name string was appended after the first packet of streamed tool calls [‡](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.16#:~:text=%2A%20Bugfix%3A%20%5BOpenAI,packet%20of%20streamed%20function%20calls).
---

###### [👾 LM Studio 0.3.15](/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.15) • 2025-04-24

### Improved Tool Use API Support

OpenAI-like REST API now supports the `tool_choice` parameter:

```json
{
  "tool_choice": "auto" // or "none", "required"
}
```

- `"tool_choice": "none"` — Model will not call tools
- `"tool_choice": "auto"` — Model decides
- `"tool_choice": "required"` — Model must call tools (llama.cpp only)

Chunked responses now set `"finish_reason": "tool_calls"` when appropriate.

---

###### [👾 LM Studio 0.3.14](/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.14) • 2025-03-27

### [API/SDK] Preset Support

RESTful API and SDKs support specifying presets in requests.

_(example needed)_

###### [👾 LM Studio 0.3.10](/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.10) • 2025-02-18

### Speculative Decoding API

Enable speculative decoding in API requests with `"draft_model"`:

```json
{
  "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b",
  "draft_model": "deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-0.5b",
  "messages": [ ... ]
}
```

Responses now include a `stats` object for speculative decoding:

```json
"stats": {
  "tokens_per_second": ...,
  "draft_model": "...",
  "total_draft_tokens_count": ...,
  "accepted_draft_tokens_count": ...,
  "rejected_draft_tokens_count": ...,
  "ignored_draft_tokens_count": ...
}
```

---

###### [👾 LM Studio 0.3.9](blog/lmstudio-v0.3.9) • 2025-01-30

### Idle TTL and Auto Evict

Set a TTL (in seconds) for models loaded via API requests (docs article: [Idle TTL and Auto-Evict](/docs/api/ttl-and-auto-evict))

```diff
curl http://localhost:1234/api/v0/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b",
    "messages": [ ... ]
+   "ttl": 300,
}'
```

With `lms`:

```
lms load --ttl <seconds>
```

### Separate `reasoning_content` in Chat Completion responses

For DeepSeek R1 models, get reasoning content in a separate field. See more [here](/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.9#separate-reasoningcontent-in-chat-completion-responses).

Turn this on in App Settings > Developer.

---

<br>

###### [👾 LM Studio 0.3.6](blog/lmstudio-v0.3.6) • 2025-01-06

### Tool and Function Calling API

Use any LLM that supports Tool Use and Function Calling through the OpenAI-like API.

Docs: [Tool Use and Function Calling](/docs/api/tools).

---

<br>

###### [👾 LM Studio 0.3.5](blog/lmstudio-v0.3.5) • 2024-10-22

### Introducing `lms get`: download models from the terminal

You can now download models directly from the terminal using a keyword

```bash
lms get deepseek-r1
```

or a full Hugging Face URL

```bash
lms get <hugging face url>
```

To filter for MLX models only, add `--mlx` to the command.

```bash
lms get deepseek-r1 --mlx
```

### Run llama.cpp (GGUF) or MLX models

LM Studio supports running LLMs on Mac, Windows, and Linux using [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

On Apple Silicon Macs, LM Studio also supports running LLMs using Apple's [`MLX`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).

To install or manage LM Runtimes, press `⌘` `Shift` `R` on Mac or `Ctrl` `Shift` `R` on Windows/Linux.

<hr>

### Run an LLM like `Llama`, `Phi`, or `DeepSeek R1` on your computer

To run an LLM on your computer you first need to download the model weights.

You can do this right within LM Studio! See [Download an LLM](app/basics/download-model) for guidance.

<hr>

### Chat with documents entirely offline on your computer

You can attach documents to your chat messages and interact with them entirely offline, also known as "RAG".

Read more about how to use this feature in the [Chat with Documents](app/basics/rag) guide.

### Use LM Studio's API from your own apps and scripts

LM Studio provides a REST API that you can use to interact with your local models from your own apps and scripts.

- [OpenAI Compatibility API](api/openai-api)
- [LM Studio REST API (beta)](api/rest-api)

title: Offline Operation
description: LM Studio can operate entirely offline, just make sure to get some model files first.
index: 4
---

```lms_notice
In general, LM Studio does not require the internet in order to work. This includes core functions like chatting with models, chatting with documents, or running a local server, none of which require the internet.
```

### Operations that do NOT require connectivity

#### Using downloaded LLMs

Once you have an LLM onto your machine, the model will run locally and you should be good to go entirely offline. Nothing you enter into LM Studio when chatting with LLMs leaves your device.

#### Chatting with documents (RAG)

When you drag and drop a document into LM Studio to chat with it or perform RAG, that document stays on your machine. All document processing is done locally, and nothing you upload into LM Studio leaves the application.

#### Running a local server

LM Studio can be used as a server to provide LLM inferencing on localhost or the local network. Requests to LM Studio use OpenAI endpoints and return OpenAI-like response objects, but stay local.

### Operations that require connectivity

Several operations, described below, rely on internet connectivity. Once you get an LLM onto your machine, you should be good to go entirely offline.

#### Searching for models

When you search for models in the Discover tab, LM Studio makes network requests (e.g. to huggingface.co). Search will not work without internet connection.

#### Downloading new models

In order to download models you need a stable (and decently fast) internet connection. You can also 'sideload' models (use models that were procured outside the app). See instructions for [sideloading models](/docs/advanced/sideload).

#### Discover tab's model catalog

Any given version of LM Studio ships with an initial model catalog built-in. The entries in the catalog are typically the state of the online catalog near the moment we cut the release. However, in order to show stats and download options for each model, we need to make network requests (e.g. to huggingface.co).

#### Downloading runtimes

[LM Runtimes](advanced/lm-runtimes) are individually packaged software libraries, or LLM engines, that allow running certain formats of models (e.g. `llama.cpp`). As of LM Studio 0.3.0 (read the [announcement](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.0)) it's easy to download and even hot-swap runtimes without a full LM Studio update. To check for available runtimes, and to download them, we need to make network requests.

#### Checking for app updates

On macOS and Windows, LM Studio has a built-in app updater that's capable. The linux in-app updater [is in the works](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-bug-tracker/issues/89). When you open LM Studio, the app updater will make a network request to check if there are any new updates available. If there's a new version, the app will show you a notification to update now or later.
Without internet connectivity you will not be able to update the app via the in-app updater.

LM Studio has a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with local LLMs. You can create many different conversation threads and manage them in folders.

<img src="/assets/docs/chatTab.png" style="width: 500px; margin-top:30px" data-caption="Manage your conversations in the Chat tab" />

<hr>

### Create a new chat

You can create a new chat by clicking the "+" button or by using a keyboard shortcut: `⌘` + `N` on Mac, or `ctrl` + `N` on Windows / Linux.

### Create a folder

Create a new folder by clicking the new folder button or by pressing: `⌘` + `shift` + `N` on Mac, or `ctrl` + `shift` + `N` on Windows / Linux.

### Drag and drop

You can drag and drop chats in and out of folders, and even drag folders into folders!

### Duplicate chats

You can duplicate a whole chat conversation by clicking the `•••` menu and selecting "Duplicate". If the chat has any files in it, they will be duplicated too.

## FAQ

#### Where are chats stored in the file system?

Right-click on a chat and choose "Reveal in Finder" / "Show in File Explorer".
Conversations are stored in JSON format. It is NOT recommended to edit them manually, nor to rely on their structure.

#### Does the model learn from chats?

The model doesn't 'learn' from chats. The model only 'knows' the content that is present in the chat or is provided to it via configuration options such as the "system prompt".

## Conversations folder filesystem path

Mac / Linux:

```shell
~/.lmstudio/conversations/
```

Windows:

```ps
%USERPROFILE%\.lmstudio\conversations
```

LM Studio comes with a built-in model downloader that let's you download any supported model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).

<img src="/assets/docs/discover.png" style="width: 500px; margin-top:30px" data-caption="Download models from the Discover tab in LM Studio" />

<hr>

### Searching for models

You can search for models by keyword (e.g. `llama`, `gemma`, `lmstudio`), or by providing a specific `user/model` string. You can even insert full Hugging Face URLs into the search bar!

###### Pro tip: you can jump to the Discover tab from anywhere by pressing `⌘` + `2` on Mac, or `ctrl` + `2` on Windows / Linux.

### Which download option to choose?

You will often see several options for any given model named things like `Q3_K_S`, `Q_8` etc. These are all copies of the same model, provided in varying degrees of fidelity. The `Q` represents a technique called "Quantization", which roughly means compressing model files in size, while giving up some degree of quality.

Choose a 4-bit option or higher if your machine is capable enough for running it.

---

You can use compatible models you've downloaded outside of LM Studio by placing them in the expected directory structure.

<hr>

### Use `lms import` (experimental)

To import a `GGUF` model you've downloaded outside of LM Studio, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
lms import <path/to/model.gguf>
```

###### Follow the interactive prompt to complete the import process.

### LM Studio's expected models directory structure

<img src="/assets/docs/reveal-models-dir.png" style="width:80%" data-caption="Manage your models directory in the My Models tab">

LM Studio aims to preserves the directory structure of models downloaded from Hugging Face. The expected directory structure is as follows:

```xml
~/.lmstudio/models/
└── publisher/
    └── model/
        └── model-file.gguf
```

For example, if you have a model named `ocelot-v1` published by `infra-ai`, the structure would look like this:

```xml
~/.lmstudio/models/
└── infra-ai/
    └── ocelot-v1/
        └── ocelot-v1-instruct-q4_0.gguf

You can use openly available Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3.1, Phi-3, and Gemma 2 locally in LM Studio, leveraging your computer's CPU and optionally the GPU.

Double check computer meets the minimum [system requirements](/docs/system-requirements).

<br>

```lms_info
You might sometimes see terms such as `open-source models` or `open-weights models`. Different models might be released under different licenses and varying degrees of 'openness'. In order to run a model locally, you need to be able to get access to its "weights", often distributed as one or more files that end with `.gguf`, `.safetensors` etc.
```

<hr>

## Getting up and running

First, **install the latest version of LM Studio**. You can get it from [here](/download).

Once you're all set up, you need to **download your first LLM**.

### 1. Download an LLM to your computer

Head over to the Discover tab to download models. Pick one of the curated options or search for models by search query (e.g. `"Llama"`). See more in-depth information about downloading models [here](/docs/basics/download-models).

<img src="/assets/docs/discover.png" style="width: 500px; margin-top:30px" data-caption="The Discover tab in LM Studio" />

### 2. Load a model to memory

Head over to the **Chat** tab, and

1. Open the model loader
2. Select one of the models you downloaded (or [sideloaded](/docs/advanced/sideload)).
3. Optionally, choose load configuration parameters.

<img src="/assets/docs/loader.png" data-caption="Quickly open the model loader with `cmd` + `L` on macOS or `ctrl` + `L` on Windows/Linux" />

##### What does loading a model mean?

Loading a model typically means allocating memory to be able to accomodate the model's weights and other parameters in your computer's RAM.

### 3. Chat!

Once the model is loaded, you can start a back-and-forth conversation with the model in the Chat tab.

FILE: 0_app/1_basics/rag.md
================================================
---
title: Chat with Documents
description: How to provide local documents to an LLM as additional context
index: 4
---

You can attach document files (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`) to chat sessions in LM Studio.

This will provide additional context to LLMs you chat with through the app.

<hr>

### Terminology

- **Retrieval**: Identifying relevant portion of a long source document
- **Query**: The input to the retrieval operation
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\*
- **Context**: the 'working memory' of an LLM. Often limited at a few thousand words\*\*

###### \* In this context, 'Generation' means the output of the LLM.

###### \*\* A recent trend in newer LLMs is support for larger context sizes.

###### Context sizes are measured in "tokens". One token is often about 3/4 of a word.

### RAG vs. Full document 'in context'

If the document is short enough (i.e., if it fits in the model's context), LM Studio will add the file contents to the conversation in full. This is particularly useful for models that support longer context sizes such as Meta's Llama 3.1 and Mistral Nemo.

If the document is very long, LM Studio will opt into using "Retrieval Augmented Generation", frequently referred to as "RAG". RAG means attempting to fish out relevant bits of a very long document (or several documents) and providing them to the model for reference. This technique sometimes works really well, but sometimes it requires some tuning and experimentation.

### Tip for successful RAG

provide as much context in your query as possible. Mention terms, ideas, and words you expect to be in the relevant source material. This will often increase the chance the system will provide useful context to the LLM. As always, experimentation is the best way to find what works best.

title: Use MCP Servers
description: Connect MCP servers to LM Studio
index: 1
---

Starting LM Studio 0.3.17, LM Studio acts as an **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Host**. This means you can connect MCP servers to the app and make them available to your models.

### Be cautious

Never install MCPs from untrusted sources.

```lms_warning
Some MCP servers can run arbitrary code, access your local files, and use your network connection. Always be cautious when installing and using MCP servers. If you don't trust the source, don't install it.
```

# Use MCP servers in LM Studio

Starting 0.3.17 (b10), LM Studio supports both local and remote MCP servers. You can add MCPs by editing the app's `mcp.json` file or via the ["Add to LM Studio" Button](mcp/deeplink), when available. LM Studio currently follows Cursor's `mcp.json` notation.

## Install new servers: `mcp.json`

Switch to the "Program" tab in the right hand sidebar. Click `Install > Edit mcp.json`.

<img src="/assets/docs/install-mcp.png"  data-caption="" style="width: 80%;" className="" />

<br>

This will open the `mcp.json` file in the in-app editor. You can add MCP servers by editing this file.

<img src="/assets/docs/mcp-editor.png"  data-caption="Edit mcp.json using the in-app editor" style="width: 100%;" className="" />

      }
    }
  }
}
```

###### You will need to replace `<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>` with your actual Hugging Face token. Learn more [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).

Use the [deeplink button](mcp/deeplink), or copy the JSON snippet above and paste it into your `mcp.json` file.

---

## Gotchas and Troubleshooting

- Never install MCP servers from untrusted sources. Some MCPs can have far reaching access to your system.

- Some MCP servers were designed to be used with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini and might use excessive amounts of tokens.

  - Watch out for this. It may quickly bog down your local model and trigger frequent context overflows.

- When adding MCP servers manually, copy only the content after `"mcpServers": {` and before the closing `}`.

description: You can import preset files directly from disk, or pull presets made by others via URL.
index: 2
---

You can import preset by file or URL. This is useful for sharing presets with others, or for importing presets from other users.

<hr>

# Import Presets

First, click the presets dropdown in the sidebar. You will see a list of your presets along with 2 buttons: `+ New Preset` and `Import`.

Click the `Import` button to import a preset.

<img src="/assets/docs/preset-import-button.png" data-caption="Import Presets" />

## Import Presets from File

Once you click the Import button, you can select the source of the preset you want to import. You can either import from a file or from a URL.
<img src="/assets/docs/import-preset-from-file.png" data-caption="Import one or more Presets from file" />

## Import Presets from URL

Presets that are [published](/docs/app/presets/publish) to the LM Studio Hub can be imported by providing their URL.

Importing public presets does not require logging in within LM Studio.

<img src="/assets/docs/import-preset-from-url.png" data-caption="Import Presets by URL" />

### Using `lms` CLI
You can also use the CLI to import presets from URL. This is useful for sharing presets with others.

```
lms get {author}/{preset-name}
```

Example:
```bash
lms get neil/qwen3-thinking
```


### Find your config-presets directory

LM Studio manages config presets on disk. Presets are local and private by default. You or others can choose to share them by sharing the file.

Click on the `•••` button in the Preset dropdown and select "Reveal in Finder" (or "Show in Explorer" on Windows).
<img src="/assets/docs/preset-reveal-in-finder.png" data-caption="Reveal Preset in your local file system" />

This will download the preset file and automatically surface it in the preset dropdown in the app. 

### Where Hub shared presets are stored
Presets you share, and ones you download from the LM Studio Hub are saved in `~/.lmstudio/hub` on macOS and Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\.lmstudio\hub` on Windows.

title: Config Presets
sidebar_title: Overview
description: Save your system prompts and other parameters as Presets for easy reuse across chats.
index: 1
---

Presets are a way to bundle together a system prompt and other parameters into a single configuration that can be easily reused across different chats.

New in 0.3.15: You can [import](/docs/app/presets/import) Presets from file or URL, and even [publish](/docs/app/presets/publish) your own Presets to share with others on to the LM Studio Hub.
<hr>

## Saving, resetting, and deselecting Presets

Below is the anatomy of the Preset manager:

<img src="/assets/docs/preset-widget-anatomy.png" style="width:70%" data-caption="The anatomy of the Preset manager in the settings sidebar.">

## Importing, Publishing, and Updating Downloaded Presets

Presets are JSON files. You can share them by sending around the JSON, or you can share them by publishing them to the LM Studio Hub.
You can also import Presets from other users by URL. See the [Import](/docs/app/presets/import) and [Publish](/docs/app/presets/publish) sections for more details.

## Example: Build your own Prompt Library

You can create your own prompt library by using Presets.

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="width:60vh;" data-caption="Save collections of parameters as a Preset for easy reuse." class="border border-border">
  <source src="https://files.lmstudio.ai/presets.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

In addition to system prompts, every parameter under the Advanced Configuration sidebar can be recorded in a named Preset.

For example, you might want to always use a certain Temperature, Top P, or Max Tokens for a particular use case. You can save these settings as a Preset (with or without a system prompt) and easily switch between them.

#### The Use Case for Presets

- Save your system prompts, inference parameters as a named `Preset`.
- Easily switch between different use cases, such as reasoning, creative writing, multi-turn conversations, or brainstorming.

## Where Presets are stored

Presets are stored in the following directory:

#### macOS or Linux

```xml
~/.lmstudio/config-presets
```

#### Windows

```xml
%USERPROFILE%\.lmstudio\config-presets
```

### Migration from LM Studio 0.2.\* Presets

- Presets you've saved in LM Studio 0.2.\* are automatically readable in 0.3.3 with no migration step needed.
- If you save **new changes** in a **legacy preset**, it'll be **copied** to a new format upon save.
  - The old files are NOT deleted.
- Notable difference: Load parameters are not included in the new preset format.
  - Favor editing the model's default config in My Models. See [how to do it here](/docs/configuration/per-model).

Intro about LM Studio SDKs in general and what capabilities are supported.

(should probably reference [Running LM Studio as a server](/docs/headless))

## How to get started

Language specific introductions are provided to help new users get started:

* [Getting started with the LM Studio Python SDK](/docs/sdk/python)
* [Getting started with the LM Studio Typescript SDK](/docs/sdk/typescript)

## Next steps

The remainder of this SDK documentation then covers specific operations in detail
for each language, with example code provided for:

* the Python convenience API (intended primarily for interactive use)
* the Python client instance API (which offers more explicit resource management)
* the Typescript SDK

`Advanced`

Starting in v[0.3.5](/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.5), LM Studio can be run as a service without the GUI. This is useful for running LM Studio on a server or in the background on your local machine.

<hr>

### Run LM Studio as a service

Running LM Studio as a service consists of several new features intended to make it more efficient to use LM Studio as a developer tool.

1. The ability to run LM Studio without the GUI
2. The ability to start the LM Studio LLM server on machine login, headlessly
3. On-demand model loading

<hr>

### Run the LLM service on machine login

To enable this, head to app settings (`Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `,`) and check the box to run the LLM server on login.

<img src="/assets/docs/headless-settings.png" style="" data-caption="Enable the LLM server to start on machine login" />

When this setting is enabled, exiting the app will minimize it to the system tray, and the LLM server will continue to run in the background.

<hr>

### Just-In-Time (JIT) model loading for OpenAI endpoints

Useful when utilizing LM Studio as an LLM service with other frontends or applications.

<img src="/assets/docs/jit-loading.png" style="" data-caption="Load models on demand" />

<hr>

#### When JIT loading is ON:

- Call to `/v1/models` will return all downloaded models, not only the ones loaded into memory
- Calls to inference endpoints will load the model into memory if it's not already loaded

#### When JIT loading is OFF:

- Call to `/v1/models` will return only the models loaded into memory
- You have to first load the model into memory before being able to use it

##### What about auto unloading?

As of LM Studio 0.3.5, auto unloading is not yet in place. Models that are loaded via JIT loading will remain in memory until you unload them.
We expect to implement more sophisticated memory management in the near future. Let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

<hr>

### Auto Server Start

Your last server state will be saved and restored on app or service launch.

To achieve this programmatically, you can use the following command:

```bash
lms server start
```

```lms_protip
If you haven't already, bootstrap `lms` on your machine by following the instructions [here](/docs/cli).
```

<hr>

You can serve local LLMs from LM Studio's Developer tab, either on localhost or on the network.

LM Studio's APIs can be used through an [OpenAI compatibility mode](/docs/app/api/endpoints/openai), enhanced [REST API](/docs/app/api/endpoints/rest), or through a client library like [lmstudio-js](/docs/api/sdk).

#### API options

- [TypeScript SDK](/docs/typescript) - `lmstudio-js`
- [Python SDK](/docs/python) - `lmstudio-python`
- [LM Studio REST API](/docs/app/api/endpoints/rest) (new, in beta)
- [OpenAI Compatibility endpoints](/docs/app/api/endpoints/openai)

title: Structured Output
description: Enforce LLM response formats using JSON schemas.
---

You can enforce a particular response format from an LLM by providing a JSON schema to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, via LM Studio's REST API (or via any OpenAI client).

<hr>

### Start LM Studio as a server
To use LM Studio programatically from your own code, run LM Studio as a local server.

You can turn on the server from the "Developer" tab in LM Studio, or via the `lms` CLI:

```
lms server start
```
###### Install `lms` by running `npx lmstudio install-cli`

This will allow you to interact with LM Studio via an OpenAI-like REST API. For an intro to LM Studio's OpenAI-like API, see [Running LM Studio as a server](/docs/basics/server).

<br>

### Structured Output

The API supports structured JSON outputs through the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint when given a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema). Doing this will cause the LLM to respond in valid JSON conforming to the schema provided.

It follows the same format as OpenAI's recently announced [Structured Output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) API and is expected to work via the OpenAI client SDKs.

**Example using `curl`**

This example demonstrates a structured output request using the `curl` utility.

To run this example on Mac or Linux, use any terminal. On Windows, use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

```bash
curl http://{{hostname}}:{{port}}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "{{model}}",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful jokester."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Tell me a joke."
      }
    ],
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "joke_response",
        "strict": "true",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "joke": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
        "required": ["joke"]
        }
      }
    },
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 50,
    "stream": false
  }'
```

All parameters recognized by `/v1/chat/completions` will be honored, and the JSON schema should be provided in the `json_schema` field of `response_format`.

The JSON object will be provided in `string` form in the typical response field, `choices[0].message.content`, and will need to be parsed into a JSON object.

**Example using `python`**
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

# Initialize OpenAI client that points to the local LM Studio server
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1",
    api_key="lm-studio"
)

# Define the conversation with the AI
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Create 1-3 fictional characters"}
]

# Define the expected response structure
character_schema = {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
        "name": "characters",
        "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "characters": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "name": {"type": "string"},
                            "occupation": {"type": "string"},
                            "personality": {"type": "string"},
                            "background": {"type": "string"}
                        },
                        "required": ["name", "occupation", "personality", "background"]
                    },
                    "minItems": 1,
                }
            },
            "required": ["characters"]
        },
    }
}

# Get response from AI
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="your-model",
    messages=messages,
    response_format=character_schema,
)

# Parse and display the results
results = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

**Important**: Not all models are capable of structured output, particularly LLMs below 7B parameters.

Check the model card README if you are unsure if the model supports structured output.

### Structured output engine

- For `GGUF` models: utilize `llama.cpp`'s grammar-based sampling APIs.
- For `MLX` models: using [Outlines](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines). 

The MLX implementation is available on Github: [lmstudio-ai/mlx-engine](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/mlx-engine).

title: Tool Use
sidebar_title: Tools and Function Calling
description: Enable LLMs to interact with external functions and APIs.
---

Tool use enables LLMs to request calls to external functions and APIs through the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, via LM Studio's REST API (or via any OpenAI client). This expands their functionality far beyond text output.

<hr>

> 🔔 Tool use requires LM Studio 0.3.6 or newer, [get it here](https://lmstudio.ai/download)

## Quick Start

### 1. Start LM Studio as a server

To use LM Studio programmatically from your own code, run LM Studio as a local server.

You can turn on the server from the "Developer" tab in LM Studio, or via the `lms` CLI:

```bash
lms server start
```

###### Install `lms` by running `npx lmstudio install-cli`

This will allow you to interact with LM Studio via an OpenAI-like REST API. For an intro to LM Studio's OpenAI-like API, see [Running LM Studio as a server](/docs/basics/server).

### 2. Load a Model

You can load a model from the "Chat" or "Developer" tabs in LM Studio, or via the `lms` CLI:

```bash
lms load
```

### 3. Copy, Paste, and Run an Example!

- `Curl`
  - [Single Turn Tool Call Request](#example-using-curl)
- `Python`
  - [Single Turn Tool Call + Tool Use](#single-turn-example)
  - [Multi-Turn Example](#multi-turn-example)
  - [Advanced Agent Example](#advanced-agent-example)

## Tool Use

### What really is "Tool Use"?

Tool use describes:

- LLMs output text requesting functions to be called (LLMs cannot directly execute code)
- Your code executes those functions
- Your code feeds the results back to the LLM.

### High-level flow

```

### In-depth flow

LM Studio supports tool use through the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint when given function definitions in the `tools` parameter of the request body. Tools are specified as an array of function definitions that describe their parameters and usage, like:

It follows the same format as OpenAI's [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) API and is expected to work via the OpenAI client SDKs.

We will use [lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF) as the model in this example flow.

1. You provide a list of tools to an LLM. These are the tools that the model can _request_ calls to.
   For example:

   ```json
   // the list of tools is model-agnostic
   [
     {
       "type": "function",
       "function": {
         "name": "get_delivery_date",
         "description": "Get the delivery date for a customer's order",
         "parameters": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "order_id": {
               "type": "string"
             }
           },
           "required": ["order_id"]
         }
       }
     }
   ]
   ```

   This list will be injected into the `system` prompt of the model depending on the model's chat template. For `Qwen2.5-Instruct`, this looks like:

   ```json
   <|im_start|>system
   You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.

   # Tools

   You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

   You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
   <tools>
   {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_delivery_date", "description": "Get the delivery date for a customer's order", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"order_id": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["order_id"]}}}
   </tools>

   For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
   <tool_call>
   {"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}
   </tool_call><|im_end|>
   ```

   **Important**: The model can only _request_ calls to these tools because LLMs _cannot_ directly call functions, APIs, or any other tools. They can only output text, which can then be parsed to programmatically call the functions.

2. When prompted, the LLM can then decide to either:

   - (a) Call one or more tools

   ```xml
   User: Get me the delivery date for order 123
   Model: <tool_call>
   {"name": "get_delivery_date", "arguments": {"order_id": "123"}}
   </tool_call>
   ```

   - (b) Respond normally

   ```xml
   User: Hi
   Model: Hello! How can I assist you today?
   ```

3. LM Studio parses the text output from the model into an OpenAI-compliant `chat.completion` response object.

   - If the model was given access to `tools`, LM Studio will attempt to parse the tool calls into the `response.choices[0].message.tool_calls` field of the `chat.completion` response object.
   - If LM Studio cannot parse any **correctly formatted** tool calls, it will simply return the response to the standard `response.choices[0].message.content` field.
   - **Note**: Smaller models and models that were not trained for tool use may output improperly formatted tool calls, resulting in LM Studio being unable to parse them into the `tool_calls` field. This is useful for troubleshooting when you do not receive `tool_calls` as expected. Example of an improperly formatting `Qwen2.5-Instruct` tool call:

   ```xml
   <tool_call>
   ["name": "get_delivery_date", function: "date"]
   </tool_call>
   ```

   > Note that the brackets are incorrect, and the call does not follow the `name, argument` format.

4. Your code parses the `chat.completion` response to check for tool calls from the model, then calls the appropriate tools with the parameters specified by the model. Your code then adds both:

   1. The model's tool call message
   2. The result of the tool call

   To the `messages` array to send back to the model

   ```python
   # pseudocode, see examples for copy-paste snippets
   if response.has_tool_calls:
       for each tool_call:
           # Extract function name & args
           function_to_call = tool_call.name     # e.g. "get_delivery_date"
           args = tool_call.arguments            # e.g. {"order_id": "123"}

           # Execute the function
           result = execute_function(function_to_call, args)

           # Add result to conversation
           add_to_messages([
               ASSISTANT_TOOL_CALL_MESSAGE,      # The request to use the tool
               TOOL_RESULT_MESSAGE               # The tool's response
           ])
   else:
       # Normal response without tools
       add_to_messages(response.content)
   ```

5. The LLM is then prompted again with the updated messages array, but without access to tools. This is because:
   - The LLM already has the tool results in the conversation history
   - We want the LLM to provide a final response to the user, not call more tools
   ```python
   # Example messages
   messages = [
       {"role": "user", "content": "When will order 123 be delivered?"},
       {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {
           "name": "get_delivery_date",
           "arguments": {"order_id": "123"}
       }},
       {"role": "tool", "content": "2024-03-15"},
   ]
   response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="lmstudio-community/qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
       messages=messages
   )
   ```
   The `response.choices[0].message.content` field after this call may be something like:
   ```xml
   Your order #123 will be delivered on March 15th, 2024
   ```
6. The loop continues back at step 2 of the flow

Note: This is the `pedantic` flow for tool use. However, you can certainly experiment with this flow to best fit your use case.

<br>

## Supported Models

Through LM Studio, **all** models support at least some degree of tool use.

However, there are currently two levels of support that may impact the quality of the experience: Native and Default.

Models with Native tool use support will have a hammer badge in the app, and generally perform better in tool use scenarios.

### Native tool use support

"Native" tool use support means that both:

1. The model has a chat template that supports tool use (usually means the model has been trained for tool use)
   - This is what will be used to format the `tools` array into the system prompt and tell them model how to format tool calls
   - Example: [Qwen2.5-Instruct chat template](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-4bit/blob/c26a38f6a37d0a51b4e9a1eb3026530fa35d9fed/tokenizer_config.json#L197)
2. LM Studio supports that model's tool use format
   - Required for LM Studio to properly input the chat history into the chat template, and parse the tool calls the model outputs into the `chat.completion` object

Models that currently have native tool use support in LM Studio (subject to change):

- Qwen
  - `GGUF` [lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF) (4.68 GB)

### Default tool use support

"Default" tool use support means that **either**:

1. The model does not have chat template that supports tool use (usually means the model has not been trained for tool use)
2. LM Studio does not currently support that model's tool use format

Under the hood, default tool use works by:

- Giving models a custom system prompt and a default tool call format to use
- Converting `tool` role messages to the `user` role so that chat templates without the `tool` role are compatible
- Converting `assistant` role `tool_calls` into the default tool call format

Results will vary by model.

You can see the default format by running `lms log stream` in your terminal, then sending a chat completion request with `tools` to a model that doesn't have Native tool use support. The default format is subject to change.

input: "<start_of_turn>system
You are a tool-calling AI. You can request calls to available tools with this EXACT format:
[TOOL_REQUEST]{"name": "tool_name", "arguments": {"param1": "value1"}}[END_TOOL_REQUEST]

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{
  "type": "toolArray",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_delivery_date",
        "description": "Get the delivery date for a customer's order",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "order_id": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "order_id"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
- Only use tools from AVAILABLE TOOLS
- Include all required arguments
- Use one [TOOL_REQUEST] block per tool
- Never use [TOOL_RESULT]
- If you decide to call one or more tools, there should be no other text in your message

Examples:
"Check Paris weather"
[TOOL_REQUEST]{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"location": "Paris"}}[END_TOOL_REQUEST]

"Send email to John about meeting and open browser"
[TOOL_REQUEST]{"name": "send_email", "arguments": {"to": "John", "subject": "meeting"}}[END_TOOL_REQUEST]
[TOOL_REQUEST]{"name": "open_browser", "arguments": {}}[END_TOOL_REQUEST]

Respond conversationally if no matching tools exist.<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>user
Get me delivery date for order 123<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model
"
```

If the model follows this format exactly to call tools, i.e:

```
[TOOL_REQUEST]{"name": "get_delivery_date", "arguments": {"order_id": "123"}}[END_TOOL_REQUEST]
```

Then LM Studio will be able to parse those tool calls into the `chat.completions` object, just like for natively supported models.

</details>

All models that don't have native tool use support will have default tool use support.

<br>

## Example using `curl`

This example demonstrates a model requesting a tool call using the `curl` utility.

To run this example on Mac or Linux, use any terminal. On Windows, use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

```bash
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "lmstudio-community/qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What dell products do you have under $50 in electronics?"}],
    "tools": [
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "search_products",
          "description": "Search the product catalog by various criteria. Use this whenever a customer asks about product availability, pricing, or specifications.",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "query": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Search terms or product name"
              },
              "category": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Product category to filter by",
                "enum": ["electronics", "clothing", "home", "outdoor"]
              },
              "max_price": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Maximum price in dollars"
              }
            },
            "required": ["query"],
            "additionalProperties": false
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

All parameters recognized by `/v1/chat/completions` will be honored, and the array of available tools should be provided in the `tools` field.

If the model decides that the user message would be best fulfilled with a tool call, an array of tool call request objects will be provided in the response field, `choices[0].message.tool_calls`.

The `finish_reason` field of the top-level response object will also be populated with `"tool_calls"`.

An example response to the above `curl` request will look like:

```bash
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-gb1t1uqzefudice8ntxd9i",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1730913210,
  "model": "lmstudio-community/qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "finish_reason": "tool_calls",
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": [
          {
            "id": "365174485",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
              "name": "search_products",
              "arguments": "{\"query\":\"dell\",\"category\":\"electronics\",\"max_price\":50}"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 263,
    "completion_tokens": 34,
    "total_tokens": 297
  },
  "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/qwen2.5-7b-instruct"
}
```

In plain english, the above response can be thought of as the model saying:

> "Please call the `search_products` function, with arguments:
>
> - 'dell' for the `query` parameter,
> - 'electronics' for the `category` parameter
> - '50' for the `max_price` parameter
>
> and give me back the results"

The `tool_calls` field will need to be parsed to call actual functions/APIs. The below examples demonstrate how.

<br>

## Examples using `python`

Tool use shines when paired with program languages like python, where you can implement the functions specified in the `tools` field to programmatically call them when the model requests.

### Single-turn example

Below is a simple single-turn (model is only called once) example of enabling a model to call a function called `say_hello` that prints a hello greeting to the console:

`single-turn-example.py`

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Connect to LM Studio
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")

# Define a simple function
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Tell the AI about our function
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "say_hello",
            "description": "Says hello to someone",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "name": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The person's name"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["name"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Ask the AI to use our function
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="lmstudio-community/qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you say hello to Bob the Builder?"}],
    tools=tools
)

# Get the name the AI wants to use a tool to say hello to
# (Assumes the AI has requested a tool call and that tool call is say_hello)
tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]
name = eval(tool_call.function.arguments)["name"]

# Actually call the say_hello function
say_hello(name) # Prints: Hello, Bob the Builder!

```

Running this script from the console should yield results like:

```xml
-> % python single-turn-example.py
Hello, Bob the Builder!
```

Play around with the name in

```python
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you say hello to Bob the Builder?"}]
```

to see the model call the `say_hello` function with different names.

### Multi-turn example

Now for a slightly more complex example.

In this example, we'll:

1. Enable the model to call a `get_delivery_date` function
2. Hand the result of calling that function back to the model, so that it can fulfill the user's request in plain text

<details>

def get_delivery_date(order_id: str) -> datetime:
    # Generate a random delivery date between today and 14 days from now
    # in a real-world scenario, this function would query a database or API
    today = datetime.now()
    random_days = random.randint(1, 14)
    delivery_date = today + timedelta(days=random_days)
    print(

get_delivery_date function returns delivery date:

2024-11-19 13:03:17.773298

Final model response with knowledge of the tool call result:

Your order number 1017 is scheduled for delivery on November 19, 2024, at 13:03 PM.
```

### Advanced agent example

Building upon the principles above, we can combine LM Studio models with locally defined functions to create an "agent" - a system that pairs a language model with custom functions to understand requests and perform actions beyond basic text generation.

The agent in the below example can:

1. Open safe urls in your default browser
2. Check the current time
3. Analyze directories in your file system

### Streaming

When streaming through `/v1/chat/completions` (`stream=true`), tool calls are sent in chunks. Function names and arguments are sent in pieces via `chunk.choices[0].delta.tool_calls.function.name` and `chunk.choices[0].delta.tool_calls.function.arguments`.

For example, to call `get_current_weather(location="San Francisco")`, the streamed `ChoiceDeltaToolCall` in each `chunk.choices[0].delta.tool_calls[0]` object will look like:

```py
ChoiceDeltaToolCall(index=0, id='814890118', function=ChoiceDeltaToolCallFunction(arguments='', name='get_current_weather'), type='function')
ChoiceDeltaToolCall(index=0, id=None, function=ChoiceDeltaToolCallFunction(arguments='{"', name=None), type=None)
ChoiceDeltaToolCall(index=0, id=None, function=ChoiceDeltaToolCallFunction(arguments='location', name=None), type=None)
ChoiceDeltaToolCall(index=0, id=None, function=ChoiceDeltaToolCallFunction(arguments='":"', name=None), type=None)
ChoiceDeltaToolCall(index=0, id=None, function=ChoiceDeltaToolCallFunction(arguments='San Francisco', name=None), type=None)
ChoiceDeltaToolCall(index=0, id=None, function=ChoiceDeltaToolCallFunction(arguments='"}', name=None), type=None)
```

These chunks must be accumulated throughout the stream to form the complete function signature for execution.

title: Idle TTL and Auto-Evict
description: Optionally auto-unload idle models after a certain amount of time (TTL)
index: 2
---

```lms_noticechill
ℹ️ Requires LM Studio 0.3.9 (b1), currently in beta. Download from [here](https://lmstudio.ai/beta-releases)
```

LM Studio 0.3.9 (b1) introduces the ability to set a _time-to-live_ (TTL) for API models, and optionally auto-evict previously loaded models before loading new ones.

These features complement LM Studio's [on-demand model loading (JIT)](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.5#on-demand-model-loading) to automate efficient memory management and reduce the need for manual intervention.

## Background

- `JIT loading` makes it easy to use your LM Studio models in other apps: you don't need to manually load the model first before being able to use it. However, this also means that models can stay loaded in memory even when they're not being used. `[Default: enabled]`

- (New) `Idle TTL` (technically: Time-To-Live) defines how long a model can stay loaded in memory without receiving any requests. When the TTL expires, the model is automatically unloaded from memory. You can set a TTL using the `ttl` field in your request payload. `[Default: 60 minutes]`

- (New) `Auto-Evict` is a feature that unloads previously JIT loaded models before loading new ones. This enables easy switching between models from client apps without having to manually unload them first. You can enable or disable this feature in Developer tab > Server Settings. `[Default: enabled]`

## Idle TTL

**Use case**: imagine you're using an app like [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/lmstudio/src/lmstudio.rs#L340), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/api/providers/lmstudio.ts), or [Continue.dev](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/model-providers/more/lmstudio) to interact with LLMs served by LM Studio. These apps leverage JIT to load models on-demand the first time you use them.

**Problem**: When you're not actively using a model, you might don't want it to remain loaded in memory.

**Solution**: Set a TTL for models loaded via API requests. The idle timer resets every time the model receives a request, so it won't disappear while you use it. A model is considered idle if it's not doing any work. When the idle TTL expires, the model is automatically unloaded from memory.

### Set App-default Idle TTL

By default, JIT-loaded models have a TTL of 60 minutes. You can configure a default TTL value for any model loaded via JIT like so:

<img src="/assets/docs/app-default-ttl.png" style="width: 500px; " data-caption="Set a default TTL value. Will be used for all JIT loaded models unless specified otherwise in the request payload" />

### Set per-model TTL-model in API requests

When JIT loading is enabled, the **first request** to a model will load it into memory. You can specify a TTL for that model in the request payload.

This works for requests targeting both the [OpenAI compatibility API](openai-api) and the [LM Studio's REST API](rest-api):

<br>

```diff
curl http://localhost:1234/api/v0/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b",
+   "ttl": 300,
    "messages": [ ... ]
}'
```

###### This will set a TTL of 5 minutes (300 seconds) for this model if it is JIT loaded.

### Set TTL for models loaded with `lms`

By default, models loaded with `lms load` do not have a TTL, and will remain loaded in memory until you manually unload them.

You can set a TTL for a model loaded with `lms` like so:

```bash
lms load <model> --ttl 3600
```

###### Load a `<model>` with a TTL of 1 hour (3600 seconds)

### Specify TTL when loading models in the server tab

You can also set a TTL when loading a model in the server tab like so

<img src="/assets/docs/ttl-server-model.png" style="width: 100%;" data-caption="Set a TTL value when loading a model in the server tab" />

## Configure Auto-Evict for JIT loaded models

With this setting, you can ensure new models loaded via JIT automatically unload previously loaded models first.

This is useful when you want to switch between models from another app without worrying about memory building up with unused models.

<img src="/assets/docs/auto-evict-and-ttl.png" style="width: 500px; margin-top:30px" data-caption="Enable or disable Auto-Evict for JIT loaded models in the Developer tab > Server Settings" />

**When Auto-Evict is ON** (default):

- At most `1` model is kept loaded in memory at a time (when loaded via JIT)
- Non-JIT loaded models are not affected

**When Auto-Evict is OFF**:

- Switching models from an external app will keep previous models loaded in memory
- Models will remain loaded until either:
  - Their TTL expires
  - You manually unload them

This feature works in tandem with TTL to provide better memory management for your workflow.

### Nomenclature

`TTL`: Time-To-Live, is a term borrowed from networking protocols and cache systems. It defines how long a resource can remain allocated before it's considered stale and evicted.

Send requests to Chat Completions (text and images), Completions, and Embeddings endpoints.

<hr>

### OpenAI-like API endpoints

LM Studio accepts requests on several OpenAI endpoints and returns OpenAI-like response objects.

#### Supported endpoints

```
GET  /v1/models
POST /v1/chat/completions
POST /v1/embeddings
POST /v1/completions
```

###### See below for more info about each endpoint

<hr>

### Re-using an existing OpenAI client

```lms_protip
You can reuse existing OpenAI clients (in Python, JS, C#, etc) by switching up the "base URL" property to point to your LM Studio instead of OpenAI's servers.
```

#### Switching up the `base url` to point to LM Studio

###### Note: The following examples assume the server port is `1234`

##### Python

```diff
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
+    base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1"
)

# ... the rest of your code ...
```

##### Typescript

```diff
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
+  baseUrl: "http://localhost:1234/v1"
});

// ... the rest of your code ...
```

##### cURL

```diff
- curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
+ curl http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
-     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
+     "model": "use the model identifier from LM Studio here",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7
   }'
```

<hr>

### Endpoints overview

#### `/v1/models`

- `GET` request
- Lists the currently **loaded** models.

##### cURL example

```bash
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models
```

#### `/v1/chat/completions`

- `POST` request
- Send a chat history and receive the assistant's response
- Prompt template is applied automatically
- You can provide inference parameters such as temperature in the payload. See [supported parameters](#supported-payload-parameters)
- See [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) for more information
- As always, keep a terminal window open with [`lms log stream`](/docs/cli/log-stream) to see what input the model receives

##### Python example

```python
# Example: reuse your existing OpenAI setup
from openai import OpenAI

# Point to the local server
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="model-identifier",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself."}
  ],
  temperature=0.7,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

#### `/v1/embeddings`

- `POST` request
- Send a string or array of strings and get an array of text embeddings (integer token IDs)
- See [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) for more information

##### Python example

```python
# Make sure to `pip install openai` first
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")

def get_embedding(text, model="model-identifier"):
   text = text.replace("\n", " ")
   return client.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model).data[0].embedding

print(get_embedding("Once upon a time, there was a cat."))
```

#### `/v1/completions`

```lms_warning
This OpenAI-like endpoint is no longer supported by OpenAI.  LM Studio continues to support it.

Using this endpoint with chat-tuned models might result in unexpected behavior such as extraneous role tokens being emitted by the model.


For best results, utilize a base model.
```

- `POST` request
- Send a string and get the model's continuation of that string
- See [supported payload parameters](#supported-payload-parameters)
- Prompt template will NOT be applied, even if the model has one
- See [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) for more information
- As always, keep a terminal window open with [`lms log stream`](/docs/cli/log-stream) to see what input the model receives

<hr>

### Supported payload parameters

For an explanation for each parameter, see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create.

```py
model
top_p
top_k
messages
temperature
max_tokens
stream

LM Studio now has its own REST API, in addition to OpenAI compatibility mode ([learn more](/docs/app/api/endpoints/openai)).

The REST API includes enhanced stats such as Token / Second and Time To First Token (TTFT), as well as rich information about models such as loaded vs unloaded, max context, quantization, and more.

#### Supported API Endpoints

- [`GET /api/v0/models`](#get-apiv0models) - List available models
- [`GET /api/v0/models/{model}`](#get-apiv0modelsmodel) - Get info about a specific model
- [`POST /api/v0/chat/completions`](#post-apiv0chatcompletions) - Chat Completions (messages -> assistant response)
- [`POST /api/v0/completions`](#post-apiv0completions) - Text Completions (prompt -> completion)
- [`POST /api/v0/embeddings`](#post-apiv0embeddings) - Text Embeddings (text -> embedding)

###### 🚧 We are in the process of developing this interface. Let us know what's important to you on [Github](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio.js/issues) or by [email](mailto:bugs@lmstudio.ai).

`Advanced`

You can set default load settings for each model in LM Studio.

When the model is loaded anywhere in the app (including through [`lms load`](/docs/cli#load-a-model-with-options)) these settings will be used.

<hr>

### Setting default parameters for a model

Head to the My Models tab and click on the gear ⚙️ icon to edit the model's default parameters.

<img src="/assets/docs/model-settings-gear.png" style="width:80%" data-caption="Click on the gear icon to edit the default load settings for a model.">

This will open a dialog where you can set the default parameters for the model.

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="width:50%" data-caption="You can set the default parameters for a model in this dialog.">
  <source src="https://files.lmstudio.ai/default-params.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Next time you load the model, these settings will be used.


```lms_protip
#### Reasons to set default load parameters (not required, totally optional)

- Set a particular GPU offload settings for a given model
- Set a particular context size for a given model
- Whether or not to utilize Flash Attention for a given model

```




## Advanced Topics

### Changing load settings before loading a model

When you load a model, you can optionally change the default load settings.

<img src="/assets/docs/load-model.png" style="width:80%" data-caption="You can change the load settings before loading a model.">

### Saving your changes as the default settings for a model

If you make changes to load settings when you load a model, you can save them as the default settings for that model.

`Advanced`

By default, LM Studio will automatically configure the prompt template based on the model file's metadata. 

However, you can customize the prompt template for any model.

<hr>


### Overriding the Prompt Template for a Specific Model

Head over to the My Models tab and click on the gear ⚙️ icon to edit the model's default parameters.
###### Pro tip: you can jump to the My Models tab from anywhere by pressing `⌘` + `3` on Mac, or `ctrl` + `3` on Windows / Linux.

### Customize the Prompt Template

###### 💡 In most cases you don't need to change the prompt template

When a model doesn't come with a prompt template information, LM Studio will surface the `Prompt Template` config box in the **🧪 Advanced Configuration** sidebar.

<img src="/assets/docs/prompt-template.png" style="width:80%" data-caption="The Prompt Template config box in the chat sidebar">

You can make this config box always show up by right clicking the sidebar and selecting **Always Show Prompt Template**.

### Prompt template options

#### Jinja Template
You can express the prompt template in Jinja.

###### 💡 [Jinja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)) is a templating engine used to encode the prompt template in several popular LLM model file formats.

#### Manual

You can also express the prompt template manually by specifying message role prefixes and suffixes.

<hr>

#### Reasons you might want to edit the prompt template:
1. The model's metadata is incorrect, incomplete, or LM Studio doesn't recognize it
2. The model does not have a prompt template in its metadata (e.g. custom or older models)
3. You want to customize the prompt template for a specific use case

title: Speculative Decoding
description: "Speed up generation with a draft model"
---

`Advanced`

Speculative decoding is a technique that can substantially increase the generation speed of large language models (LLMs) without reducing response quality.

<hr>

> 🔔 Speculative Decoding requires LM Studio 0.3.10 or newer, currently in beta. [Get it here](https://lmstudio.ai/beta-releases).

## What is Speculative Decoding

Speculative decoding relies on the collaboration of two models:

- A larger, "main" model
- A smaller, faster "draft" model

During generation, the draft model rapidly proposes potential tokens (subwords), which the main model can verify faster than it would take it to generate them from scratch. To maintain quality, the main model only accepts tokens that match what it would have generated. After the last accepted draft token, the main model always generates one additional token.

For a model to be used as a draft model, it must have the same "vocabulary" as the main model.

## How to enable Speculative Decoding

On `Power User` mode or higher, load a model, then select a `Draft Model` within the `Speculative Decoding` section of the chat sidebar:

<img src="/assets/docs/speculative-decoding-setting.png" style="width:80%; margin-top: 20px; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" data-caption="The Speculative Decoding section of the chat sidebar">

### Finding compatible draft models

You might see the following when you open the dropdown:

<img src="/assets/docs/speculative-decoding-no-compatible.png" style="width:40%; margin-top: 20px; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" data-caption="No compatible draft models">

Try to download a lower parameter variant of the model you have loaded, if it exists. If no smaller versions of your model exist, find a pairing that does.

For example:

<center style="margin: 20px;">

|          Main Model          |          Draft Model          |
| :--------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
|    Llama 3.1 8B Instruct     |     Llama 3.2 1B Instruct     |
|    Qwen 2.5 14B Instruct     |    Qwen 2.5 0.5B Instruct     |
| DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 32B | DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 1.5B |

</center>

Once you have both a main and draft model loaded, simply begin chatting to enable speculative decoding.

## Key factors affecting performance

Speculative decoding speed-up is generally dependent on two things:

1. How small and fast the _draft model_ is compared with the _main model_
2. How often the draft model is able to make "good" suggestions

In simple terms, you want to choose a draft model that's much smaller than the main model. And some prompts will work better than others.

### An important trade-off

Running a draft model alongside a main model to enable speculative decoding requires more **computation and resources** than running the main model on its own.

The key to faster generation of the main model is choosing a draft model that's both small and capable enough.

Here are general guidelines for the **maximum** draft model size you should select based on main model size (in parameters):

<center style="margin: 20px;">

| Main Model Size | Max Draft Model Size to Expect Speed-Ups |
| :-------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|       3B        |                    -                     |
|       7B        |                    1B                    |
|       14B       |                    3B                    |
|       32B       |                    7B                    |

</center>

Generally, the larger the size difference is between the main model and the draft model, the greater the speed-up.

Note: if the draft model is not fast enough or effective enough at making "good" suggestions to the main model, the generation speed will not increase, and could actually decrease.

### Prompt dependent

One thing you will likely notice when using speculative decoding is that the generation speed is not consistent across all prompts.

The reason that the speed-up is not consistent across all prompts is because for some prompts, the draft model is less likely to make "good" suggestions to the main model.

Here are some extreme examples that illustrate this concept:

#### 1. Discrete Example: Mathematical Question

Prompt: "What is the quadratic equation formula?"

In this case, both a 70B model and a 0.5B model are both very likely to give the standard formula `x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a)`. So if the draft model suggested this formula as the next tokens, the target model would likely accept it, making this an ideal case for speculative decoding to work efficiently.

#### 2. Creative Example: Story Generation

Prompt: "Write a story that begins: 'The door creaked open...'"

In this case, the smaller model's draft tokens are likely be rejected more often by the larger model, as each next word could branch into countless valid possibilities.

While "4" is the only reasonable answer to "2+2", this story could continue with "revealing a monster", "as the wind howled", "and Sarah froze", or hundreds of other perfectly valid continuations, making the smaller model's specific word predictions much less likely to match the larger
model's choices.

`lmstudio-python` provides you a set APIs to interact with LLMs, embeddings models, and agentic flows.

## Installing the SDK

`lmstudio-python` is available as a PyPI package. You can install it using pip.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    pip:
      language: bash
      code: |
        pip install lmstudio
```

For the source code and open source contribution, visit [lmstudio-python](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-python) on GitHub.

## Features

- Use LLMs to [respond in chats](./python/llm-prediction/chat-completion) or predict [text completions](./python/llm-prediction/completion)
- Define functions as tools, and turn LLMs into [autonomous agents](./python/agent) that run completely locally
- [Load](./python/manage-models/loading), [configure](./python/llm-prediction/parameters), and [unload](./python/manage-models/loading) models from memory
- Generate embeddings for text, and more!

## Quick Example: Chat with a Llama Model

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm("llama-3.2-1b-instruct")
        result = model.respond("What is the meaning of life?")

        print(result)

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model("llama-3.2-1b-instruct")
            result = model.respond("What is the meaning of life?")

            print(result)
```

### Getting Local Models

The above code requires the Llama 3.2 1B model.
If you don't have the model, run the following command in the terminal to download it.

```bash
lms get llama-3.2-1b-instruct
```

Read more about `lms get` in LM Studio's CLI [here](./cli/get).

# Interactive Convenience or Deterministic Resource Management?

As shown in the example above, there are two distinct approaches for working
with the LM Studio Python SDK.

The first is the interactive convenience API (listed as "Python (convenience API)"
in examples), which focuses on the use of a default LM Studio client instance for
convenient interactions at a Python prompt, or when using Jupyter notebooks.

The second is a scoped resource API (listed as "Python (scoped resource API)"
in examples), which uses context managers to ensure that allocated resources
(such as network connections) are released deterministically, rather than
potentially remaining open until the entire process is terminated.

`lmstudio` is a library published on PyPI that allows you to use `lmstudio-python` in your own projects.
It is open source and developed on GitHub.
You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-python).

## Installing `lmstudio-python`

As it is published to PyPI, `lmstudio-python` may be installed using `pip`
or your preferred project dependency manager (`pdm` and `uv` are shown, but other
Python project management tools offer similar dependency addition commands).

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    pip:
      language: bash
      code: |
        pip install lmstudio
    pdm:
      language: bash
      code: |
        pdm add lmstudio
    uv:
      language: bash
      code: |
        uv add lmstudio
```

## Customizing the server API host and TCP port

All of the examples in the documentation assume that the server API is running locally
on the default port. The network location of the server API can be overridden by
passing a `"host:port"` string when creating the client instance.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        SERVER_API_HOST = "localhost:1234"

        # This must be the *first* convenience API interaction (otherwise the SDK
        # implicitly creates a client that accesses the default server API host)
        lms.configure_default_client(SERVER_API_HOST)

        # Note: the dedicated configuration API was added in lmstudio-python 1.3.0
        # For compatibility with earlier SDK versions, it is still possible to use
        # lms.get_default_client(SERVER_API_HOST) to configure the default client

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        SERVER_API_HOST = "localhost:1234"

        # When using the scoped resource API, each client instance
        # can be configured to use a specific server API host
        with lms.Client(SERVER_API_HOST) as client:
            model = client.llm.model()

            for fragment in model.respond_stream("What is the meaning of life?"):
                print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
            print() # Advance to a new line at the end of the response
```

title: "Using `lmstudio-python` in REPL"
sidebar_title: "REPL Usage"
description: "You can use `lmstudio-python` in REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to interact with LLMs, manage models, and more."
index: 2
---

To enable interactive use, `lmstudio-python` offers a convenience API which manages
its resources via `atexit` hooks, allowing a default synchronous client session
to be used across multiple interactive commands.

This convenience API is shown in the examples throughout the documentation as the
`Python (convenience API)` tab (alongside the `Python (scoped resource API)` examples,
which use `with` statements to ensure deterministic cleanup of network communication
resources).

The convenience API allows the standard Python REPL, or more flexible alternatives like
Juypter Notebooks, to be used to interact with AI models loaded into LM Studio. For
example:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "Python REPL"
  variants:
    "Interactive chat session":
      language: python
      code: |
        >>> import lmstudio as lms
        >>> loaded_models = lms.list_loaded_models()
        >>> for idx, model in enumerate(loaded_models):
        ...     print(f"{idx:>3} {model}")
        ...
          0 LLM(identifier='qwen2.5-7b-instruct')
        >>> model = loaded_models[0]
        >>> chat = lms.Chat("You answer questions concisely")
        >>> chat = lms.Chat("You answer questions concisely")
        >>> chat.add_user_message("Tell me three fruits")
        UserMessage(content=[TextData(text='Tell me three fruits')])
        >>> print(model.respond(chat, on_message=chat.append))
        Banana, apple, orange.
        >>> chat.add_user_message("Tell me three more fruits")
        UserMessage(content=[TextData(text='Tell me three more fruits')])
        >>> print(model.respond(chat, on_message=chat.append))
        Mango, strawberry, avocado.
        >>> chat.add_user_message("How many fruits have you told me?")
        UserMessage(content=[TextData(text='How many fruits have you told me?')])
        >>> print(model.respond(chat, on_message=chat.append))
        You asked for three initial fruits and three more, so I've listed a total of six fruits.

```

title: Cancelling Predictions
description: Stop an ongoing prediction in `lmstudio-python`

One benefit of using the streaming API is the ability to cancel the
prediction request based on criteria that can't be represented using
the `stopStrings` or `maxPredictedTokens` configuration settings.

The following snippet illustrates cancelling the request in response
to an application specification cancellation condition (such as polling
an event set by another thread).

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm()

        prediction_stream = model.respond_stream("What is the meaning of life?")
        cancelled = False
        for fragment in prediction_stream:
            if ...: # Cancellation condition will be app specific
                cancelled = True
                prediction_stream.cancel()
                # Note: it is recommended to let the iteration complete,
                # as doing so allows the partial result to be recorded.
                # Breaking the loop *is* permitted, but means the partial result
                # and final prediction stats won't be available to the client
        # The stream allows the prediction result to be retrieved after iteration
        if not cancelled:
            print(prediction_stream.result())

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()

            prediction_stream = model.respond_stream("What is the meaning of life?")
            cancelled = False
            for fragment in prediction_stream:
                if ...: # Cancellation condition will be app specific
                    cancelled = True
                    prediction_stream.cancel()
                    # Note: it is recommended to let the iteration complete,
                    # as doing so allows the partial result to be recorded.
                    # Breaking the loop *is* permitted, but means the partial result

            if not cancelled:

Use `llm.respond(...)` to generate completions for a chat conversation.

## Quick Example: Generate a Chat Response

The following snippet shows how to obtain the AI's response to a quick chat prompt.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm()
        print(model.respond("What is the meaning of life?"))

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()
            print(model.respond("What is the meaning of life?"))
```

## Streaming a Chat Response

The following snippet shows how to stream the AI's response to a chat prompt,
displaying text fragments as they are received (rather than waiting for the
entire response to be generated before displaying anything).

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm()

        for fragment in model.respond_stream("What is the meaning of life?"):
            print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
        print() # Advance to a new line at the end of the response

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()

            for fragment in model.respond_stream("What is the meaning of life?"):
                print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
            print() # Advance to a new line at the end of the response

```

## Cancelling a Chat Response

See the [Cancelling a Prediction](./cancelling-predictions) section for how to cancel a prediction in progress.

## Obtain a Model

First, you need to get a model handle.
This can be done using the top-level `llm` convenience API,
or the `model` method in the `llm` namespace when using the scoped resource API.
For example, here is how to use Qwen2.5 7B Instruct.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")

```

There are other ways to get a model handle. See [Managing Models in Memory](./../manage-models/loading) for more info.

## Manage Chat Context

The input to the model is referred to as the "context".
Conceptually, the model receives a multi-turn conversation as input,
and it is asked to predict the assistant's response in that conversation.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Constructing a Chat object":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        # Create a chat with an initial system prompt.
        chat = lms.Chat("You are a resident AI philosopher.")

        # Build the chat context by adding messages of relevant types.
        chat.add_user_message("What is the meaning of life?")
        # ... continued in next example

  "From chat history data":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        # Create a chat object from a chat history dict
        chat = lms.Chat.from_history({
            "messages": [
                { "role": "system", "content": "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
                { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?" },
            ]
        })
        # ... continued in next example

```

See [Working with Chats](./working-with-chats) for more information on managing chat context.

<!-- , and [`Chat`](./../api-reference/chat) for API reference for the `Chat` class. -->

## Generate a response

You can ask the LLM to predict the next response in the chat context using the `respond()` method.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        # The `chat` object is created in the previous step.
        result = model.respond(chat)

        print(result)

    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        # The `chat` object is created in the previous step.
        prediction_stream = model.respond_stream(chat)

        for fragment in prediction_stream:
            print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
        print() # Advance to a new line at the end of the response
```

## Customize Inferencing Parameters

You can pass in inferencing parameters via the `config` keyword parameter on `.respond()`.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        prediction_stream = model.respond_stream(chat, config={
            "temperature": 0.6,
            "maxTokens": 50,
        })

    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        result = model.respond(chat, config={
            "temperature": 0.6,
            "maxTokens": 50,
        })
```

See [Configuring the Model](./parameters) for more information on what can be configured.

## Print prediction stats

You can also print prediction metadata, such as the model used for generation, number of generated
tokens, time to first token, and stop reason.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        # After iterating through the prediction fragments,
        # the overall prediction result may be obtained from the stream
        result = prediction_stream.result()

        print("Model used:", result.model_info.display_name)
        print("Predicted tokens:", result.stats.predicted_tokens_count)
        print("Time to first token (seconds):", result.stats.time_to_first_token_sec)
        print("Stop reason:", result.stats.stop_reason)
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        # `result` is the response from the model.
        print("Model used:", result.model_info.display_name)
        print("Predicted tokens:", result.stats.predicted_tokens_count)
        print("Time to first token (seconds):", result.stats.time_to_first_token_sec)
        print("Stop reason:", result.stats.stop_reason)
```

## Example: Multi-turn Chat

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "chatbot.py"
  variants:
    Python:
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()
        chat = lms.Chat("You are a task focused AI assistant")

        while True:
            try:
                user_input = input("You (leave blank to exit): ")
            except EOFError:
                print()
                break
            if not user_input:
                break
            chat.add_user_message(user_input)
            prediction_stream = model.respond_stream(
                chat,
                on_message=chat.append,
            )
            print("Bot: ", end="", flush=True)
            for fragment in prediction_stream:
                print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
            print()

```

### Progress Callbacks

Long prompts will often take a long time to first token, i.e. it takes the model a long time to process your prompt.
If you want to get updates on the progress of this process, you can provide a float callback to `respond`
that receives a float from 0.0-1.0 representing prompt processing progress.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Python (convenience API):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        llm = lms.llm()

        response = llm.respond(
            "What is LM Studio?",
            on_prompt_processing_progress = (lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% complete")),
        )

    Python (scoped resource API):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            llm = client.llm.model()

            response = llm.respond(
                "What is LM Studio?",
                on_prompt_processing_progress = (lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% complete")),
            )

```

In addition to `on_prompt_processing_progress`, the other available progress callbacks are:

- `on_first_token`: called after prompt processing is complete and the first token is being emitted.
  Does not receive any arguments (use the streaming iteration API or `on_prediction_fragment`
  to process tokens as they are emitted).
- `on_prediction_fragment`: called for each prediction fragment received by the client.
  Receives the same prediction fragments as iterating over the stream iteration API.
- `on_message`: called with an assistant response message when the prediction is complete.
  Intended for appending received messages to a chat history instance.



================================================
FILE: 1_python/1_llm-prediction/completion.md
================================================
---
title: Text Completions
description: "Provide a string input for the model to complete"
---

Use `llm.complete(...)` to generate text completions from a loaded language model.
Text completions mean sending a non-formatted string to the model with the expectation that the model will complete the text.

This is different from multi-turn chat conversations. For more information on chat completions, see [Chat Completions](./chat-completion).

## 1. Instantiate a Model

First, you need to load a model to generate completions from.
This can be done using the top-level `llm` convenience API,
or the `model` method in the `llm` namespace when using the scoped resource API.
For example, here is how to use Qwen2.5 7B Instruct.


```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")

```

## 2. Generate a Completion

Once you have a loaded model, you can generate completions by passing a string to the `complete` method on the `llm` handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        # The `chat` object is created in the previous step.
        result = model.complete("My name is", config={"maxTokens": 100})

        print(result)

    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        # The `chat` object is created in the previous step.
        prediction_stream = model.complete_stream("My name is", config={"maxTokens": 100})

        for fragment in prediction_stream:
            print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
        print() # Advance to a new line at the end of the response
```

## 3. Print Prediction Stats

You can also print prediction metadata, such as the model used for generation, number of generated tokens, time to first token, and stop reason.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        # `result` is the response from the model.
        print("Model used:", result.model_info.display_name)
        print("Predicted tokens:", result.stats.predicted_tokens_count)
        print("Time to first token (seconds):", result.stats.time_to_first_token_sec)
        print("Stop reason:", result.stats.stop_reason)

    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        # After iterating through the prediction fragments,
        # the overall prediction result may be obtained from the stream
        result = prediction_stream.result()

        print("Model used:", result.model_info.display_name)
        print("Predicted tokens:", result.stats.predicted_tokens_count)
        print("Time to first token (seconds):", result.stats.time_to_first_token_sec)
        print("Stop reason:", result.stats.stop_reason)
```

## Example: Get an LLM to Simulate a Terminal

Here's an example of how you might use the `complete` method to simulate a terminal.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "terminal-sim.py"
  variants:
    Python:
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()
        console_history = []

        while True:
            try:
                user_command = input("$ ")
            except EOFError:
                print()
                break
            if user_command.strip() == "exit":
                break
            console_history.append(f"$ {user_command}")
            history_prompt = "\n".join(console_history)
            prediction_stream = model.complete_stream(
                history_prompt,
                config={ "stopStrings": ["$"] },
            )
            for fragment in prediction_stream:
                print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
            print()
            console_history.append(prediction_stream.result().content)

```

## Customize Inferencing Parameters

You can pass in inferencing parameters via the `config` keyword parameter on `.complete()`.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        prediction_stream = model.complete_stream(initial_text, config={
            "temperature": 0.6,
            "maxTokens": 50,
        })

    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        result = model.complete(initial_text, config={
            "temperature": 0.6,
            "maxTokens": 50,
        })
```

See [Configuring the Model](./parameters) for more information on what can be configured.

### Progress Callbacks

Long prompts will often take a long time to first token, i.e. it takes the model a long time to process your prompt.
If you want to get updates on the progress of this process, you can provide a float callback to `complete`
that receives a float from 0.0-1.0 representing prompt processing progress.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Python (convenience API):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        llm = lms.llm()

        completion = llm.complete(
            "My name is",
            on_prompt_processing_progress = (lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% complete")),
        )

    Python (scoped resource API):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            llm = client.llm.model()

            completion = llm.complete(
                "My name is",
                on_prompt_processing_progress = (lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% processed")),
            )

```

In addition to `on_prompt_processing_progress`, the other available progress callbacks are:

* `on_first_token`: called after prompt processing is complete and the first token is being emitted.
  Does not receive any arguments (use the streaming iteration API or `on_prediction_fragment`
  to process tokens as they are emitted).
* `on_prediction_fragment`: called for each prediction fragment received by the client.
  Receives the same prediction fragments as iterating over the stream iteration API.
* `on_message`: called with an assistant response message when the prediction is complete.
  Intended for appending received messages to a chat history instance.

================================================
---
title: Image Input
description: API for passing images as input to the model
index: 2
---

*Required Python SDK version*: **1.1.0**

Some models, known as VLMs (Vision-Language Models), can accept images as input. You can pass images to the model using the `.respond()` method.

### Prerequisite: Get a VLM (Vision-Language Model)

If you don't yet have a VLM, you can download a model like `qwen2-vl-2b-instruct` using the following command:

```bash
lms get qwen2-vl-2b-instruct
```

## 1. Instantiate the Model

Connect to LM Studio and obtain a handle to the VLM (Vision-Language Model) you want to use.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct")

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct")

```

## 2. Prepare the Image

Use the `prepare_image()` function or `files` namespace method to
get a handle to the image that can subsequently be passed to the model.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        image_path = "/path/to/image.jpg" # Replace with the path to your image
        image_handle = lms.prepare_image(image_path)

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            image_path = "/path/to/image.jpg" # Replace with the path to your image
            image_handle = client.files.prepare_image(image_path)

```

If you only have the raw data of the image, you can supply the raw data directly as a bytes
object without having to write it to disk first. Due to this feature, binary filesystem
paths are *not* supported (as they will be handled as malformed image data rather than as
filesystem paths).

Binary IO objects are also accepted as local file inputs.

The LM Studio server supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP image formats.

## 3. Pass the Image to the Model in `.respond()`

Generate a prediction by passing the image to the model in the `.respond()` method.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        image_path = "/path/to/image.jpg" # Replace with the path to your image
        image_handle = lms.prepare_image(image_path)
        model = lms.llm("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct")
        chat = lms.Chat()
        chat.add_user_message("Describe this image please", images=[image_handle])
        prediction = model.respond(chat)

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            image_path = "/path/to/image.jpg" # Replace with the path to your image
            image_handle = client.files.prepare_image(image_path)
            model = client.llm.model("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct")
            chat = lms.Chat()
            chat.add_user_message("Describe this image please", images=[image_handle])
            prediction = model.respond(chat)

```

title: Configuring the Model
sidebar_title: Configuration Parameters
description: APIs for setting inference-time and load-time parameters for your model
---

You can customize both inference-time and load-time parameters for your model. Inference parameters can be set on a per-request basis, while load parameters are set when loading the model.

# Inference Parameters

Set inference-time parameters such as `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `topP` and more.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    ".respond()":
      language: python
      code: |
        result = model.respond(chat, config={
            "temperature": 0.6,
            "maxTokens": 50,
        })

    ".complete()":
      language: python
      code: |
        result = model.complete(chat, config={
            "temperature": 0.6,
            "maxTokens": 50,
            "stopStrings": ["\n\n"],
          })

```

See [`LLMPredictionConfigInput`](./../../typescript/api-reference/llm-prediction-config-input) in the
Typescript SDK documentation for all configurable fields.

Note that while `structured` can be set to a JSON schema definition as an inference-time configuration parameter
(Zod schemas are not supported in the Python SDK), the preferred approach is to instead set the
[dedicated `response_format` parameter](<(./structured-responses)>), which allows you to more rigorously
enforce the structure of the output using a JSON or class based schema definition.

# Load Parameters

Set load-time parameters such as the context length, GPU offload ratio, and more.

### Set Load Parameters with `.model()`

The `.model()` retrieves a handle to a model that has already been loaded, or loads a new one on demand (JIT loading).

**Note**: if the model is already loaded, the given configuration will be **ignored**.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct", config={
            "contextLength": 8192,
            "gpu": {
              "ratio": 0.5,
            }
        })

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model(
                "qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
                config={
                    "contextLength": 8192,
                    "gpu": {
                      "ratio": 0.5,
                    }
                }
            )

```

See [`LLMLoadModelConfig`](./../../typescript/api-reference/llm-load-model-config) in the
Typescript SDK documentation for all configurable fields.

### Set Load Parameters with `.load_new_instance()`

The `.load_new_instance()` method creates a new model instance and loads it with the specified configuration.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        client = lms.get_default_client()
        model = client.llm.load_new_instance("qwen2.5-7b-instruct", config={
            "contextLength": 8192,
            "gpu": {
              "ratio": 0.5,
            }
        })

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.load_new_instance(
                "qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
                config={
                    "contextLength": 8192,
                    "gpu": {
                      "ratio": 0.5,
                    }
                }
            )

```

title: Speculative Decoding
description: API to use a draft model in speculative decoding in `lmstudio-python`
index: 5
---

*Required Python SDK version*: **1.2.0**

Speculative decoding is a technique that can substantially increase the generation speed of large language models (LLMs) without reducing response quality. See [Speculative Decoding](./../../app/advanced/speculative-decoding) for more info.

To use speculative decoding in `lmstudio-python`, simply provide a `draftModel` parameter when performing the prediction. You do not need to load the draft model separately.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        main_model_key = "qwen2.5-7b-instruct"
        draft_model_key = "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct"

        model = lms.llm(main_model_key)
        result = model.respond(
            "What are the prime numbers between 0 and 100?",
            config={
                "draftModel": draft_model_key,
            }
        )

        print(result)
        stats = result.stats
        print(f"Accepted {stats.accepted_draft_tokens_count}/{stats.predicted_tokens_count} tokens")


    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        main_model_key = "qwen2.5-7b-instruct"
        draft_model_key = "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct"

        model = lms.llm(main_model_key)

        )
        for fragment in prediction_stream:
            print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
        print() # Advance to a new line at the end of the response

        stats = prediction_stream.result().stats
        print(f"Accepted {stats.accepted_draft_tokens_count}/{stats.predicted_tokens_count} tokens")
```

FILE: 1_python/1_llm-prediction/structured-response.md
================================================

title: Structured Response
description: Enforce a structured response from the model using Pydantic models or JSON Schema
index: 4
---

You can enforce a particular response format from an LLM by providing a JSON schema to the `.respond()` method.
This guarantees that the model's output conforms to the schema you provide.

The JSON schema can either be provided directly,
or by providing an object that implements the `lmstudio.ModelSchema` protocol,
such as `pydantic.BaseModel` or `lmstudio.BaseModel`.

The `lmstudio.ModelSchema` protocol is defined as follows:

```python
@runtime_checkable
class ModelSchema(Protocol):
    """Protocol for classes that provide a JSON schema for their model."""

    @classmethod
    def model_json_schema(cls) -> DictSchema:
        """Return a JSON schema dict describing this model."""
        ...

```

When a schema is provided, the prediction result's `parsed` field will contain a string-keyed dictionary that conforms
to the given schema (for unstructured results, this field is a string field containing the same value as `content`).


## Enforce Using a Class Based Schema Definition

If you wish the model to generate JSON that satisfies a given schema,
it is recommended to provide a class based schema definition using a library
such as [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) or [`msgspec`](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/).

Pydantic models natively implement the `lmstudio.ModelSchema` protocol,
while `lmstudio.BaseModel` is a `msgspec.Struct` subclass that implements `.model_json_schema()` appropriately.

#### Define a Class Based Schema

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "pydantic.BaseModel":
      language: python
      code: |
        from pydantic import BaseModel

        # A class based schema for a book
        class BookSchema(BaseModel):
            title: str
            author: str
            year: int

    "lmstudio.BaseModel":
      language: python
      code: |
        from lmstudio import BaseModel

        # A class based schema for a book
        class BookSchema(BaseModel):
            title: str
            author: str
            year: int

```

#### Generate a Structured Response

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        result = model.respond("Tell me about The Hobbit", response_format=BookSchema)
        book = result.parsed

        print(book)
        #           ^
        # Note that `book` is correctly typed as { title: string, author: string, year: number }

    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        prediction_stream = model.respond_stream("Tell me about The Hobbit", response_format=BookSchema)

        # Optionally stream the response
        # for fragment in prediction:
        #   print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
        # print()
        # Note that even for structured responses, the *fragment* contents are still only text

        # Get the final structured result
        result = prediction_stream.result()
        book = result.parsed

        print(book)
        #           ^
        # Note that `book` is correctly typed as { title: string, author: string, year: number }
```

## Enforce Using a JSON Schema

You can also enforce a structured response using a JSON schema.

#### Define a JSON Schema

```python
# A JSON schema for a book
schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": { "type": "string" },
    "author": { "type": "string" },
    "year": { "type": "integer" },
  },
  "required": ["title", "author", "year"],
}
```

#### Generate a Structured Response

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: python
      code: |
        result = model.respond("Tell me about The Hobbit", response_format=schema)
        book = result.parsed

        print(book)
        #     ^
        # Note that `book` is correctly typed as { title: string, author: string, year: number }

    Streaming:
      language: python
      code: |
        prediction_stream = model.respond_stream("Tell me about The Hobbit", response_format=schema)

        # Stream the response
        for fragment in prediction:
            print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)
        print()
        # Note that even for structured responses, the *fragment* contents are still only text

        # Get the final structured result
        result = prediction_stream.result()
        book = result.parsed

        print(book)
        #     ^
        # Note that `book` is correctly typed as { title: string, author: string, year: number }
```

TODO: Info about structured generation caveats

 ## Overview

Once you have [downloaded and loaded](/docs/basics/index) a large language model,
you can use it to respond to input through the API. This article covers getting JSON structured output, but you can also
[request text completions](/docs/api/sdk/completion),
[request chat responses](/docs/api/sdk/chat-completion), and
[use a vision-language model to chat about images](/docs/api/sdk/image-input).

### Usage

Certain models are trained to output valid JSON data that conforms to
a user-provided schema, which can be used programmatically in applications
that need structured data. This structured data format is supported by both
[`complete`](/docs/api/sdk/completion) and [`respond`](/docs/api/sdk/chat-completion)
methods, and relies on Pydantic in Python and Zod in TypeScript.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const Book = z.object({
          title: z.string(),
          author: z.string(),
          year: z.number().int()
        })

        const client = new LMStudioClient()
        const llm = client.llm.model()

        const response = llm.respond(
          "Tell me about The Hobbit.",
          { structured: Book },
        )

        console.log(response.content.title)
``` -->



================================================
FILE: 1_python/1_llm-prediction/working-with-chats.md
================================================

title: Working with Chats
description: APIs for representing a chat conversation with an LLM
---

SDK methods such as `llm.respond()`, `llm.applyPromptTemplate()`, or `llm.act()`
take in a chat parameter as an input.
There are a few ways to represent a chat when using the SDK.

## Option 1: Input a Single String

If your chat only has one single user message, you can use a single string to represent the chat.
Here is an example with the `.respond` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Single string":
    language: python
    code: |
      prediction = llm.respond("What is the meaning of life?")
```

## Option 2: Using the `Chat` Helper Class

For more complex tasks, it is recommended to use the `Chat` helper class.
It provides various commonly used methods to manage the chat.
Here is an example with the `Chat` class, where the initial system prompt
is supplied when initializing the chat instance, and then the initial user
message is added via the corresponding method call.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Simple chat":
    language: python
    code: |
      chat = Chat("You are a resident AI philosopher.")
      chat.add_user_message("What is the meaning of life?")

      prediction = llm.respond(chat)
```

You can also quickly construct a `Chat` object using the `Chat.from_history` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Chat history data":
    language: python
    code: |
      chat = Chat.from_history({"messages": [
        { "role": "system", "content": "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
        { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?" },
      ]})

  "Single string":
    language: python
    code: |
      # This constructs a chat with a single user message
      chat = Chat.from_history("What is the meaning of life?")

```

## Option 3: Providing Chat History Data Directly

As the APIs that accept chat histories use `Chat.from_history` internally,
they also accept the chat history data format as a regular dictionary:

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Chat history data":
    language: python
    code: |
      prediction = llm.respond({"messages": [
        { "role": "system", "content": "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
        { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?" },
      ]})
```

## Automatic tool calling

We introduce the concept of execution "rounds" to describe the combined process of running a tool, providing its output to the LLM, and then waiting for the LLM to decide what to do next.

**Execution Round**

```
 • run a tool ->
 ↑   • provide the result to the LLM ->
 │       • wait for the LLM to generate a response
 │
 └────────────────────────────────────────┘ └➔ (return)
```

A model might choose to run tools multiple times before returning a final result. For example, if the LLM is writing code, it might choose to compile or run the program, fix errors, and then run it again, rinse and repeat until it gets the desired result.

With this in mind, we say that the `.act()` API is an automatic "multi-round" tool calling API.

### Quick Example

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
            """Given two numbers a and b. Returns the product of them."""
            return a * b

        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")
        model.act(
          "What is the result of 12345 multiplied by 54321?",
          [multiply],
          on_message=print,
        )
```

### What does it mean for an LLM to "use a tool"?

LLMs are largely text-in, text-out programs. So, you may ask "how can an LLM use a tool?". The answer is that some LLMs are trained to ask the human to call the tool for them, and expect the tool output to to be provided back in some format.

Imagine you're giving computer support to someone over the phone. You might say things like "run this command for me ... OK what did it output? ... OK now click there and tell me what it says ...". In this case you're the LLM! And you're "calling tools" vicariously through the person on the other side of the line.

### Running multiple tool calls in parallel

By default, version 1.4.0 and later of the Python SDK will only run a single tool call request at a time,
even if the model requests multiple tool calls in a single response message. This ensures the requests will
be processed correctly even if the tool implementations do not support multiple concurrent calls.

When the tool implementations are known to be thread-safe, and are both slow and frequent enough to be worth
running in parallel, the `max_parallel_tool_calls` option specifies the maximum number of tool call requests
that will be processed in parallel from a single model response. This value defaults to 1 (waiting for each
tool call to complete before starting the next one). Setting this value to `None` will automatically scale
the maximum number of parallel tool calls to a multiple of the number of CPU cores available to the process.

### Important: Model Selection

The model selected for tool use will greatly impact performance.

Some general guidance when selecting a model:

- Not all models are capable of intelligent tool use
- Bigger is better (i.e., a 7B parameter model will generally perform better than a 3B parameter model)
- We've observed [Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF) to perform well in a wide variety of cases
- This guidance may change

### Example: Multiple Tools

The following code demonstrates how to provide multiple tools in a single `.act()` call.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import math
        import lmstudio as lms

        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            """Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them."""
            return a + b

        def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
            """Given a number n, returns True if n is a prime number."""
            if n < 2:
                return False
            sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n))
            for i in range(2, sqrt):
                if n % i == 0:
                    return False
            return True

        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")
        model.act(
          "Is the result of 12345 + 45668 a prime? Think step by step.",
          [add, is_prime],
          on_message=print,
        )
```

### Example: Chat Loop with Create File Tool

The following code creates a conversation loop with an LLM agent that can create files.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import readline # Enables input line editing
        from pathlib import Path

        import lmstudio as lms

        def create_file(name: str, content: str):
            """Create a file with the given name and content."""
            dest_path = Path(name)
            if dest_path.exists():
                return "Error: File already exists."
            try:
                dest_path.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
            except Exception as exc:
                return "Error: {exc!r}"
            return "File created."

        def print_fragment(fragment, round_index=0):
            # .act() supplies the round index as the second parameter
            # Setting a default value means the callback is also
            # compatible with .complete() and .respond().
            print(fragment.content, end="", flush=True)

        model = lms.llm()
        chat = lms.Chat("You are a task focused AI assistant")

        while True:
            try:
                user_input = input("You (leave blank to exit): ")
            except EOFError:
                print()
                break
            if not user_input:
                break
            chat.add_user_message(user_input)
            print("Bot: ", end="", flush=True)
            model.act(
                chat,
                [create_file],
                on_message=chat.append,
                on_prediction_fragment=print_fragment,
            )
            print()

```

### Progress Callbacks

Complex interactions with a tool using agent may take some time to process.

The regular progress callbacks for any prediction request are available,
but the expected capabilities differ from those for single round predictions.

* `on_prompt_processing_progress`: called during prompt processing for each
  prediction round. Receives the progress ratio (as a float) and the round
  index as positional arguments.
* `on_first_token`: called after prompt processing is complete for each prediction round.
  Receives the round index as its sole argument.
* `on_prediction_fragment`: called for each prediction fragment received by the client.
  Receives the prediction fragment and the round index as positional arguments.
* `on_message`: called with an assistant response message when each prediction round is
  complete, and with tool result messages as each tool call request is completed.
  Intended for appending received messages to a chat history instance, and hence
  does *not* receive the round index as an argument.

The following additional callbacks are available to monitor the prediction rounds:

* `on_round_start`: called before submitting the prediction request for each round.
  Receives the round index as its sole argument.
* `on_prediction_completed`: called after the prediction for the round has been completed,
  but before any requested tool calls have been initiated. Receives the round's prediction
  result as its sole argument. A round prediction result is a regular prediction result
  with an additional `round_index` attribute.
* `on_round_end`: called after any tool call requests for the round have been resolved.

Finally, applications may request notifications when agents emit invalid tool requests:

* `handle_invalid_tool_request`: called when a tool request was unable to be processed.
  Receives the exception that is about to be reported, as well as the original tool
  request that resulted in the problem. When no tool request is given, this is
  purely a notification of an unrecoverable error before the agent interaction raises
  the given exception (allowing the application to raise its own exception instead).
  When a tool request is given, it indicates that rather than being raised locally,
  the text description of the exception is going to be passed back to the agent
  as the result of that failed tool request. In these cases, the callback may either
  return `None` to indicate that the error description should be sent to the agent,
  raise the given exception (or a different exception) locally, or return a text
  string that should be sent to the agent instead of the error description.

For additional details on defining tools, and an example of overriding the invalid
tool request handling to raise all exceptions locally instead of passing them to
back the agent, refer to [Tool Definition](./tools.md).

title: Tool Definition
description: Define tools to be called by the LLM, and pass them to the model in the `act()` call.
index: 2
---

You can define tools as regular Python functions and pass them to the model in the `act()` call.
Alternatively, tools can be defined with `lmstudio.ToolFunctionDef` in order to control the
name and description passed to the language model.

## Anatomy of a Tool

Follow one of the following examples to define functions as tools (the first approach
is typically going to be the most convenient):

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python function":
      language: python
      code: |
        # Type hinted functions with clear names and docstrings
        # may be used directly as tool definitions
        def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            """Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them."""
            # The SDK ensures arguments are coerced to their specified types
            return a + b

        # Pass `add` directly to `act()` as a tool definition

    "ToolFunctionDef.from_callable":
      language: python
      code: |
        from lmstudio import ToolFunctionDef

        def cryptic_name(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            return a + b

        # Type hinted functions with cryptic names and missing or poor docstrings
        # can be turned into clear tool definitions with `from_callable`
        tool_def = ToolFunctionDef.from_callable(
          cryptic_name,
          name="add",
          description="Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them."
        )
        # Pass `tool_def` to `act()` as a tool definition

    "ToolFunctionDef":
      language: python
      code: |
        from lmstudio import ToolFunctionDef

        def cryptic_name(a, b):
            return a + b

        # Functions without type hints can be used without wrapping them
        # at runtime by defining a tool function directly.
        tool_def = ToolFunctionDef(
          name="add",
          description="Given two numbers a and b, returns the sum of them.",
          parameters={
            "a": int,
            "b": int,
          },
          implementation=cryptic_name,
        )
        # Pass `tool_def` to `act()` as a tool definition

```

**Important**: The tool name, description, and the parameter definitions are all passed to the model!

This means that your wording will affect the quality of the generation. Make sure to always provide a clear description of the tool so the model knows how to use it.

## Tools with External Effects (like Computer Use or API Calls)

Tools can also have external effects, such as creating files or calling programs and even APIs. By implementing tools with external effects, you
can essentially turn your LLMs into autonomous agents that can perform tasks on your local machine.

## Example: `create_file_tool`

### Tool Definition

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "create_file_tool.py"
  variants:
    Python:
      language: python
      code: |
        from pathlib import Path

        def create_file(name: str, content: str):
            """Create a file with the given name and content."""
            dest_path = Path(name)
            if dest_path.exists():
                return "Error: File already exists."
            try:
                dest_path.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
            except Exception as exc:
                return "Error: {exc!r}"
            return "File created."

```

### Example code using the `create_file` tool:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "example.py"
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms
        from create_file_tool import create_file

        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")
        model.act(
          "Please create a file named output.txt with your understanding of the meaning of life.",
          [create_file],
        )
```

## Handling tool calling errors

By default, version 1.3.0 and later of the Python SDK will automatically convert
exceptions raised by tool calls to text and report them back to the language model.
In many cases, when notified of an error in this way, a language model is able
to either adjust its request to avoid the failure, or else accept the failure as
a valid response to its request (consider a prompt like `Attempt to divide 1 by 0
using the provided tool. Explain the result.`, where the expected
response is an explanation of the `ZeroDivisionError` exception the Python
interpreter raises when instructed to divide by zero).

This error handling behaviour can be overridden using the `handle_invalid_tool_request`
callback. For example, the following code reverts the error handling back to raising
exceptions locally in the client:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "example.py"
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        def divide(numerator: float, denominator: float) -> float:
            """Divide the given numerator by the given denominator. Return the result."""
            return numerator / denominator

        model = lms.llm("qwen2.5-7b-instruct")
        chat = Chat()
        chat.add_user_message(
            "Attempt to divide 1 by 0 using the tool. Explain the result."
        )

        def _raise_exc_in_client(
            exc: LMStudioPredictionError, request: ToolCallRequest | None
        ) -> None:
            raise exc

        act_result = llm.act(
            chat,
            [divide],
            handle_invalid_tool_request=_raise_exc_in_client,
        )
```

When a tool request is passed in, the callback results are processed as follows:

* `None`: the original exception text is passed to the LLM unmodified
* a string: the returned string is passed to the LLM instead of the original
  exception text
* raising an exception (whether the passed in exception or a new exception):
  the raised exception is propagated locally in the client, terminating the
  prediction process

If no tool request is passed in, the callback invocation is a notification only,
and the exception cannot be converted to text for passing pack to the LLM
(although it can still be replaced with a different exception). These cases
indicate failures in the expected communication with the server API that mean
the prediction process cannot reasonably continue, so if the callback doesn't
raise an exception, the calling code will raise the original exception directly.

title: Embedding
sidebar_title: Generating embedding vectors
description: Generate text embeddings from input text
---

Generate embeddings for input text. Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Embeddings are a building block for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and other similarity-based tasks.

### Prerequisite: Get an Embedding Model

If you don't yet have an embedding model, you can download a model like `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` using the following command:

```bash
lms get nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```

## Create Embeddings

To convert a string to a vector representation, pass it to the `embed` method on the corresponding embedding model handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "example.py"
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.embedding_model("nomic-embed-text-v1.5")

        embedding = model.embed("Hello, world!")

```



================================================
FILE: 1_python/4_tokenization/index.md
================================================
---
title: Tokenization
sidebar_title: Tokenizing text
description: Tokenize text using a model's tokenizer
---

Models use a tokenizer to internally convert text into "tokens" they can deal with more easily. LM Studio exposes this tokenizer for utility.

## Tokenize

You can tokenize a string with a loaded LLM or embedding model using the SDK.
In the below examples, the LLM reference can be replaced with an
embedding model reference without requiring any other changes.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()

        tokens = model.tokenize("Hello, world!")

        print(tokens) # Array of token IDs.
```

## Count tokens

If you only care about the number of tokens, simply check the length of the resulting array.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        token_count = len(model.tokenize("Hello, world!"))
        print("Token count:", token_count)
```

### Example: count context

You can determine if a given conversation fits into a model's context by doing the following:

1. Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
2. Count the number of tokens in the string.
3. Compare the token count to the model's context length.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        def does_chat_fit_in_context(model: lms.LLM, chat: lms.Chat) -> bool:
            # Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
            formatted = model.apply_prompt_template(chat)
            # Count the number of tokens in the string.
            token_count = len(model.tokenize(formatted))
            # Get the current loaded context length of the model
            context_length = model.get_context_length()
            return token_count < context_length

        model = lms.llm()

        chat = lms.Chat.from_history({
            "messages": [
                { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The meaning of life is..." },
                # ... More messages
            ]
        })

        print("Fits in context:", does_chat_fit_in_context(model, chat))

```

FILE: 1_python/5_manage-models/_download-models.md
================================================
---
title: Download Models
description: Download models to the machine running the LM Studio server
---

TODO: this is available, but the current API is a bit awkward, so hold
      off on documenting it until the interface is nicer to use

## Overview

You can browse and download models using the LM Studio SDK just like you would
in the Discover tab of the app itself. Once a model is downloaded, you can
[load it](/docs/api/sdk/load-and-access-models) for inference.

### Usage

Downloading models consists of three steps:

1. Search for the model you want;
2. Find the download option you want (e.g. quantization) and
3. Download the model!

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient()

        # 1. Search for the model you want
        # Specify any/all of searchTerm, limit, compatibilityTypes
        const searchResults = client.repository.searchModels({
          searchTerm: "llama 3.2 1b",    # Search for Llama 3.2 1B
          limit: 5,                      # Get top 5 results
          compatibilityTypes: ["gguf"],  # Only download GGUFs
        })

        # 2. Find download options
        const bestResult = searchResults[0];
        const downloadOptions = bestResult.getDownloadOptions()

        # Let's download Q4_K_M, a good middle ground quantization
        const desiredModel = downloadOptions.find(option => option.quantization === 'Q4_K_M')

        # 3. Download it!
        const modelKey = desiredModel.download()

        # This returns a path you can use to load the model
        const loadedModel = client.llm.model(modelKey)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Progress callbacks

TODO: TS/python differ in callback names

Model downloading can take a very long time, depending on your local network speed.
If you want to get updates on the progress of this process, you can provide callbacks to `download`:
one for progress updates and/or one when the download is being finalized
(validating checksums, etc.)

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Python (with scoped resources):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        def print_progress_update(update: lmstudio.DownloadProgressUpdate) -> None:
            print(f"Downloaded {update.downloaded_bytes} bytes of {update.total_bytes} total \
                    at {update.speed_bytes_per_second} bytes/sec")

        with lms.Client() as client:
            # ... Same code as before ...

            model_key = desired_model.download(
                on_progress=print_progress_update,
                on_finalize: lambda: print("Finalizing download...")
            )

    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient, type DownloadProgressUpdate } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        function printProgressUpdate(update: DownloadProgressUpdate) {
          process.stdout.write(`Downloaded ${update.downloadedBytes} bytes of ${update.totalBytes} total \
                                at ${update.speed_bytes_per_second} bytes/sec`)
        }

        const client = new LMStudioClient()

        # ... Same code as before ...

        modelKey = desiredModel.download({
          onProgress: printProgressUpdate,
          onStartFinalizing: () => console.log("Finalizing..."),
        })

        const loadedModel = client.llm.model(modelKey)
```

You can iterate through locally available models using the downloaded model listing methods.

The listing results offer `.model()` and `.load_new_instance()` methods, which allow the
downloaded model reference to be converted in the full SDK handle for a loaded model.

## Available Models on the LM Studio Server

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        downloaded = lms.list_downloaded_models()
        llm_only = lms.list_downloaded_models("llm")
        embedding_only = lms.list_downloaded_models("embedding")

        for model in downloaded:
            print(model)

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            downloaded = client.list_downloaded_models()
            llm_only = client.llm.list_downloaded()
            embedding_only = client.embedding.list_downloaded()

        for model in downloaded:
            print(model)

```
This will give you results equivalent to using [`lms ls`](../../cli/ls) in the CLI.


### Example output:

```python
DownloadedLlm(model_key='qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m', display_name='Qwen2.5 7B Instruct 1M', architecture='qwen2', vision=False)
DownloadedEmbeddingModel(model_key='text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5', display_name='Nomic Embed Text v1.5', architecture='nomic-bert')

sidebar_title: Load and Access Models
description: APIs to load, access, and unload models from memory
---

AI models are huge. It can take a while to load them into memory. LM Studio's SDK allows you to precisely control this process.

**Model namespaces:**

  - LLMs are accessed through the `client.llm` namespace
  - Embedding models are accessed through the `client.embedding` namespace
  - `lmstudio.llm` is equivalent to `client.llm.model` on the default client
  - `lmstudio.embedding_model` is equivalent to `client.embedding.model` on the default client

**Most commonly:**
  - Use `.model()` to get any currently loaded model
  - Use `.model("model-key")` to use a specific model

**Advanced (manual model management):**
  - Use `.load_new_instance("model-key")` to load a new instance of a model
  - Use `.unload("model-key")` or `model_handle.unload()` to unload a model from memory

## Get the Current Model with `.model()`

If you already have a model loaded in LM Studio (either via the GUI or `lms load`),
you can use it by calling `.model()` without any arguments.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()

```

## Get a Specific Model with `.model("model-key")`

If you want to use a specific model, you can provide the model key as an argument to `.model()`.

#### Get if Loaded, or Load if not
Calling `.model("model-key")` will load the model if it's not already loaded, or return the existing instance if it is.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm("llama-3.2-1b-instruct")

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model("llama-3.2-1b-instruct")

```

<!--
Learn more about the `.model()` method and the parameters it accepts in the [API Reference](../api-reference/model).
-->

## Load a New Instance of a Model with `.load_new_instance()`

Use `load_new_instance()` to load a new instance of a model, even if one already exists.
This allows you to have multiple instances of the same or different models loaded at the same time.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        client = lms.get_default_client()
        llama = client.llm.load_new_instance("llama-3.2-1b-instruct")
        another_llama = client.llm.load_new_instance("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", "second-llama")

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            llama = client.llm.load_new_instance("llama-3.2-1b-instruct")
            another_llama = client.llm.load_new_instance("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", "second-llama")
```

<!--
Learn more about the `.load_new_instance()` method and the parameters it accepts in the [API Reference](../api-reference/load_new_instance).
-->

### Note about Instance Identifiers

If you provide an instance identifier that already exists, the server will throw an error.
So if you don't really care, it's safer to not provide an identifier, in which case
the server will generate one for you. You can always check in the server tab in LM Studio, too!

## Unload a Model from Memory with `.unload()`

Once you no longer need a model, you can unload it by simply calling `unload()` on its handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        model = lms.llm()
        model.unload()

    "Python (scoped resource API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            model = client.llm.model()
            model.unload()

```

## Set Custom Load Config Parameters

You can also specify the same load-time configuration options when loading a model, such as Context Length and GPU offload. 

See [load-time configuration](../llm-prediction/parameters) for more.

## Set an Auto Unload Timer (TTL)

You can specify a _time to live_ for a model you load, which is the idle time (in seconds)
after the last request until the model unloads. See [Idle TTL](/docs/app/api/ttl-and-auto-evict) for more on this.

```lms_protip
If you specify a TTL to `model()`, it will only apply if `model()` loads
a new instance, and will _not_ retroactively change the TTL of an existing instance.
```

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Python:
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        llama = lms.llm("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", ttl=3600)

    Python (with scoped resources):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        with lms.Client() as client:
            llama = client.llm.model("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", ttl=3600)

```

<!--
(TODO?: Cover the JIT implications of setting a TTL, and the default TTL variations)

================================================
---
title: Get Context Length
description: API to get the maximum context length of a model.
---

LLMs and embedding models, due to their fundamental architecture, have a property called `context length`, and more specifically a **maximum** context length. Loosely speaking, this is how many tokens the models can "keep in memory" when generating text or embeddings. Exceeding this limit will result in the model behaving erratically.

## Use the `get_context_length()` function on the model object

It's useful to be able to check the context length of a model, especially as an extra check before providing potentially long input to the model.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "example.py"
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        context_length = model.get_context_length()
```

The `model` in the above code snippet is an instance of a loaded model you get from the `llm.model` method. See [Manage Models in Memory](../manage-models/loading) for more information.

### Example: Check if the input will fit in the model's context window

You can determine if a given conversation fits into a model's context by doing the following:

1. Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
2. Count the number of tokens in the string.
3. Compare the token count to the model's context length.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lms

        def does_chat_fit_in_context(model: lms.LLM, chat: lms.Chat) -> bool:
            # Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
            formatted = model.apply_prompt_template(chat)
            # Count the number of tokens in the string.
            token_count = len(model.tokenize(formatted))
            # Get the current loaded context length of the model
            context_length = model.get_context_length()
            return token_count < context_length

        model = lms.llm()

        chat = lms.Chat.from_history({
            "messages": [
                { "role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The meaning of life is..." },
                # ... More messages
            ]
        })

        print("Fits in context:", does_chat_fit_in_context(model, chat))

```

### Parameters

```lms_params
- name: gpu
  description: |
    How to distribute the work to your GPUs. See {@link GPUSetting} for more information.
  public: true
  type: GPUSetting
  optional: true

- name: contextLength
  description: |
    The size of the context length in number of tokens. This will include both the prompts and the
    responses. Once the context length is exceeded, the value set in
    {@link LLMPredictionConfigBase#contextOverflowPolicy} is used to determine the behavior.

    See {@link LLMContextOverflowPolicy} for more information.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: ropeFrequencyBase
  description: |
    Custom base frequency for rotary positional embeddings (RoPE).

    This advanced parameter adjusts how positional information is embedded in the model's
    representations. Increasing this value may enable better performance at high context lengths by
    modifying how the model processes position-dependent information.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: ropeFrequencyScale
  description: |
    Scaling factor for RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding) frequency.

    This factor scales the effective context window by modifying how positional information is
    encoded. Higher values allow the model to handle longer contexts by making positional encoding
    more granular, which can be particularly useful for extending a model beyond its original
    training context length.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: evalBatchSize
  description: |
    Number of input tokens to process together in a single batch during evaluation.

    Increasing this value typically improves processing speed and throughput by leveraging
    parallelization, but requires more memory. Finding the optimal batch size often involves
    balancing between performance gains and available hardware resources.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: flashAttention
  description: |
    Enables Flash Attention for optimized attention computation.

    Flash Attention is an efficient implementation that reduces memory usage and speeds up
    generation by optimizing how attention mechanisms are computed. This can significantly
    improve performance on compatible hardware, especially for longer sequences.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: keepModelInMemory
  description: |
    When enabled, prevents the model from being swapped out of system memory.

    This option reserves system memory for the model even when portions are offloaded to GPU,
    ensuring faster access times when the model needs to be used. Improves performance
    particularly for interactive applications, but increases overall RAM requirements.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: seed
  description: |
    Random seed value for model initialization to ensure reproducible outputs.

    Setting a specific seed ensures that random operations within the model (like sampling)
    produce the same results across different runs, which is important for reproducibility
    in testing and development scenarios.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: useFp16ForKVCache
  description: |
    When enabled, stores the key-value cache in half-precision (FP16) format.

    This option significantly reduces memory usage during inference by using 16-bit floating
    point numbers instead of 32-bit for the attention cache. While this may slightly reduce
    numerical precision, the impact on output quality is generally minimal for most applications.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: tryMmap
  description: |
    Attempts to use memory-mapped (mmap) file access when loading the model.

    Memory mapping can improve initial load times by mapping model files directly from disk to
    memory, allowing the operating system to handle paging. This is particularly beneficial for
    quick startup, but may reduce performance if the model is larger than available system RAM,
    causing frequent disk access.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: numExperts
  description: |
    Specifies the number of experts to use for models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture.

    MoE models contain multiple "expert" networks that specialize in different aspects of the task.
    This parameter controls how many of these experts are active during inference, affecting both
    performance and quality of outputs. Only applicable for models designed with the MoE architecture.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: llamaKCacheQuantizationType
  description: |
    Quantization type for the Llama model's key cache.

    This option determines the precision level used to store the key component of the attention
    mechanism's cache. Lower precision values (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit quantization) significantly
    reduce memory usage during inference but may slightly impact output quality. The effect varies
    between different models, with some being more robust to quantization than others.

    Set to false to disable quantization and use full precision.
  type: LLMLlamaCacheQuantizationType | false
  optional: true

- name: llamaVCacheQuantizationType
  description: |
    Quantization type for the Llama model's value cache.

    Similar to the key cache quantization, this option controls the precision used for the value
    component of the attention mechanism's cache. Reducing precision saves memory but may affect
    generation quality. This option requires Flash Attention to be enabled to function properly.

    Different models respond differently to value cache quantization, so experimentation may be
    needed to find the optimal setting for a specific use case. Set to false to disable quantization.
  type: LLMLlamaCacheQuantizationType | false
  optional: true

title: Apply Prompt Template
description: Apply a model's prompt template to a conversation
---

## Overview

LLMs (Large Language Models) operate on a text-in, text-out basis. Before processing conversations through these models, the input must be converted into a properly formatted string using a prompt template. If you need to inspect or work with this formatted string directly, the LM Studio SDK provides a streamlined way to apply a model's prompt template to your conversations.

```lms_info
You do not need to use this method when using `.respond`. It will automatically apply the prompt template for you.
```

## Usage with a Chat

You can apply a prompt template to a `Chat` by using the `applyPromptTemplate` method. This method takes a `Chat` object as input and returns a formatted string.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import { Chat, LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        client = new LMStudioClient()
        model = client.llm.model() # Use any loaded LLM

        chat = Chat.createEmpty()
        chat.append("system", "You are a helpful assistant.")
        chat.append("user", "What is LM Studio?")
        
        formatted = model.applyPromptTemplate(chat)
        print(formatted)
```

## Usage with an Array of Messages

The same method can also be used with any object that can be converted to a `Chat`, for example, an array of messages.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Python (convenience API)":
      language: python
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        client = new LMStudioClient()
        model = client.llm.model() # Use any loaded LLM

        formatted = model.applyPromptTemplate([
          { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
          { role: "user", content: "What is LM Studio?" },
        ])
        print(formatted)
```

## Quick Example: Chat with a Llama Model

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model("llama-3.2-1b-instruct");
        const result = await model.respond("What is the meaning of life?");

        console.info(result.content);
```

### Getting Local Models

The above code requires the Llama 3.2 1B. If you don't have the model, run the following command in the terminal to download it.

```bash
lms get llama-3.2-1b-instruct
```

title: Cancelling Predictions
description: Stop an ongoing prediction in `lmstudio-js`
---

Sometimes you may want to halt a prediction before it finishes. For example, the user might change their mind or your UI may navigate away. `lmstudio-js` provides two simple ways to cancel a running prediction.

## 1. Call `.cancel()` on the prediction

Every prediction method returns an `OngoingPrediction` instance. Calling `.cancel()` stops generation and causes the final `stopReason` to be `"userStopped"`. In the example below we schedule the cancel call on a timer:

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");

        const prediction = model.respond("What is the meaning of life?", {
          maxTokens: 50,
        });
        setTimeout(() => prediction.cancel(), 1000); // cancel after 1 second

        const result = await prediction.result();
        console.info(result.stats.stopReason); // "userStopped"
```

## 2. Use an `AbortController`

If your application already uses an `AbortController` to propagate cancellation, you can pass its `signal` to the prediction method. Aborting the controller stops the prediction with the same `stopReason`:

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");

        const controller = new AbortController();
        const prediction = model.respond("What is the meaning of life?", {
          maxTokens: 50,
          signal: controller.signal,
        });
        setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 1000); // cancel after 1 second

        const result = await prediction.result();
        console.info(result.stats.stopReason); // "userStopped"
```

Both approaches halt generation immediately, and the returned stats indicate that the prediction ended because you stopped it.

title: Chat Completions
sidebar_title: Chat
description: APIs for a multi-turn chat conversations with an LLM
index: 2
---

Use `llm.respond(...)` to generate completions for a chat conversation.

## Quick Example: Generate a Chat Response

The following snippet shows how to stream the AI's response to quick chat prompt.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model();

        for await (const fragment of model.respond("What is the meaning of life?")) {
          process.stdout.write(fragment.content);
        }
```

## Obtain a Model

First, you need to get a model handle. This can be done using the `model` method in the `llm` namespace. For example, here is how to use Qwen2.5 7B Instruct.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");
```

There are other ways to get a model handle. See [Managing Models in Memory](./../manage-models/loading) for more info.

## Manage Chat Context

The input to the model is referred to as the "context". Conceptually, the model receives a multi-turn conversation as input, and it is asked to predict the assistant's response in that conversation.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Using an array of messages":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        // Create a chat object from an array of messages.
        const chat = Chat.from([
          { role: "system", content: "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
          { role: "user", content: "What is the meaning of life?" },
        ]);
    "Constructing a Chat object":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        // Create an empty chat object.
        const chat = Chat.empty();

        // Build the chat context by appending messages.
        chat.append("system", "You are a resident AI philosopher.");
        chat.append("user", "What is the meaning of life?");
```

See [Working with Chats](./working-with-chats) for more information on managing chat context.

<!-- , and [`Chat`](./../api-reference/chat) for API reference for the `Chat` class. -->

## Generate a response

You can ask the LLM to predict the next response in the chat context using the `respond()` method.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        // The `chat` object is created in the previous step.
        const prediction = model.respond(chat);

        for await (const { content } of prediction) {
          process.stdout.write(content);
        }

        console.info(); // Write a new line to prevent text from being overwritten by your shell.

    "Non-streaming":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        // The `chat` object is created in the previous step.
        const result = await model.respond(chat);

        console.info(result.content);
```

## Customize Inferencing Parameters

You can pass in inferencing parameters as the second parameter to `.respond()`.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const prediction = model.respond(chat, {
          temperature: 0.6,
          maxTokens: 50,
        });

    "Non-streaming":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const result = await model.respond(chat, {
          temperature: 0.6,
          maxTokens: 50,
        });
```

See [Configuring the Model](./parameters) for more information on what can be configured.

## Print prediction stats

You can also print prediction metadata, such as the model used for generation, number of generated
tokens, time to first token, and stop reason.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        // If you have already iterated through the prediction fragments,
        // doing this will not result in extra waiting.
        const result = await prediction.result();

        console.info("Model used:", result.modelInfo.displayName);
        console.info("Predicted tokens:", result.stats.predictedTokensCount);
        console.info("Time to first token (seconds):", result.stats.timeToFirstTokenSec);
        console.info("Stop reason:", result.stats.stopReason);
    "Non-streaming":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        // `result` is the response from the model.
        console.info("Model used:", result.modelInfo.displayName);
        console.info("Predicted tokens:", result.stats.predictedTokensCount);
        console.info("Time to first token (seconds):", result.stats.timeToFirstTokenSec);
        console.info("Stop reason:", result.stats.stopReason);
```

## Example: Multi-turn Chat

TODO: Probably needs polish here:

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat, LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { createInterface } from "readline/promises";

        const rl = createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout });
        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();
        const chat = Chat.empty();

        while (true) {
          const input = await rl.question("You: ");
          // Append the user input to the chat
          chat.append("user", input);

          const prediction = model.respond(chat, {
            // When the model finish the entire message, push it to the chat
            onMessage: (message) => chat.append(message),
          });
          process.stdout.write("Bot: ");
          for await (const { content } of prediction) {
            process.stdout.write(content);
          }
          process.stdout.write("\n");
        }
```

<!-- ### Progress callbacks

TODO: Cover onFirstToken callback (Python SDK has this now)

Long prompts will often take a long time to first token, i.e. it takes the model a long time to process your prompt.
If you want to get updates on the progress of this process, you can provide a float callback to `respond`
that receives a float from 0.0-1.0 representing prompt processing progress.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Python:
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio as lm

        llm = lm.llm()

        response = llm.respond(
            "What is LM Studio?",
            on_progress: lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% complete")
        )

    Python (with scoped resources):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio

        with lmstudio.Client() as client:
            llm = client.llm.model()

            response = llm.respond(
                "What is LM Studio?",
                on_progress: lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% processed")
            )

    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const llm = await client.llm.model();

        const prediction = llm.respond(
          "What is LM Studio?",
          {onPromptProcessingProgress: (progress) => process.stdout.write(`${progress*100}% processed`)});
```

### Prediction configuration

You can also specify the same prediction configuration options as you could in the
in-app chat window sidebar. Please consult your specific SDK to see exact syntax. -->



================================================
FILE: 2_typescript/2_llm-prediction/completion.md
================================================
---
title: Text Completions
description: "Provide a string input for the model to complete"
---

Use `llm.complete(...)` to generate text completions from a loaded language model. Text completions mean sending an non-formatted string to the model with the expectation that the model will complete the text.

This is different from multi-turn chat conversations. For more information on chat completions, see [Chat Completions](./chat-completion).

## 1. Instantiate a Model

First, you need to load a model to generate completions from. This can be done using the `model` method on the `llm` handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");
```

## 2. Generate a Completion

Once you have a loaded model, you can generate completions by passing a string to the `complete` method on the `llm` handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Streaming:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const completion = model.complete("My name is", {
          maxTokens: 100,
        });

        for await (const { content } of completion) {
          process.stdout.write(content);
        }

        console.info(); // Write a new line for cosmetic purposes

    "Non-streaming":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const completion = await model.complete("My name is", {
          maxTokens: 100,
        });

        console.info(completion.content);
```

## 3. Print Prediction Stats

You can also print prediction metadata, such as the model used for generation, number of generated tokens, time to first token, and stop reason.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        console.info("Model used:", completion.modelInfo.displayName);
        console.info("Predicted tokens:", completion.stats.predictedTokensCount);
        console.info("Time to first token (seconds):", completion.stats.timeToFirstTokenSec);
        console.info("Stop reason:", completion.stats.stopReason);
```

## Example: Get an LLM to Simulate a Terminal

Here's an example of how you might use the `complete` method to simulate a terminal.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "terminal-sim.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { createInterface } from "node:readline/promises";

        const rl = createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout });
        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();
        let history = "";

        while (true) {
          const command = await rl.question("$ ");
          history += "$ " + command + "\n";

          const prediction = model.complete(history, { stopStrings: ["$"] });
          for await (const { content } of prediction) {
            process.stdout.write(content);
          }
          process.stdout.write("\n");

          const { content } = await prediction.result();
          history += content;
        }
```

<!-- ## Advanced Usage

### Prediction metadata

Prediction responses are really returned as `PredictionResult` objects that contain additional dot-accessible metadata about the inference request.
This entails info about the model used, the configuration with which it was loaded, and the configuration for this particular prediction. It also provides
inference statistics like stop reason, time to first token, tokens per second, and number of generated tokens.

Please consult your specific SDK to see exact syntax.

### Progress callbacks

TODO: TS has onFirstToken callback which Python does not

Long prompts will often take a long time to first token, i.e. it takes the model a long time to process your prompt.
If you want to get updates on the progress of this process, you can provide a float callback to `complete`
that receives a float from 0.0-1.0 representing prompt processing progress.

            on_progress: lambda progress: print(f"{progress*100}% complete")
        )

### Prediction configuration

You can also specify the same prediction configuration options as you could in the
in-app chat window sidebar. Please consult your specific SDK to see exact syntax. -->

title: Image Input
description: API for passing images as input to the model
index: 2
---

Some models, known as VLMs (Vision-Language Models), can accept images as input. You can pass images to the model using the `.respond()` method.

### Prerequisite: Get a VLM (Vision-Language Model)

If you don't yet have a VLM, you can download a model like `qwen2-vl-2b-instruct` using the following command:

```bash
lms get qwen2-vl-2b-instruct
```

## 1. Instantiate the Model

Connect to LM Studio and obtain a handle to the VLM (Vision-Language Model) you want to use.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Example:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2-vl-2b-instruct");
```

## 2. Prepare the Image

Use the `client.files.prepareImage()` method to get a handle to the image that can be subsequently passed to the model.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Example:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const imagePath = "/path/to/image.jpg"; // Replace with the path to your image
        const image = await client.files.prepareImage(imagePath);

```

If you only have the image in the form of a base64 string, you can use the `client.files.prepareImageBase64()` method instead.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Example:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const imageBase64 = "Your base64 string here";
        const image = await client.files.prepareImageBase64(imageBase64);
```

The LM Studio server supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP image formats.

## 3. Pass the Image to the Model in `.respond()`

Generate a prediction by passing the image to the model in the `.respond()` method.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Example:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const prediction = model.respond([
          { role: "user", content: "Describe this image please", images: [image] },
        ]);
```

FILE: 2_typescript/2_llm-prediction/parameters.md
================================================

title: Configuring the Model
sidebar_title: Configuration Parameters
description: APIs for setting inference-time and load-time parameters for your model
---

You can customize both inference-time and load-time parameters for your model. Inference parameters can be set on a per-request basis, while load parameters are set when loading the model.

# Inference Parameters

Set inference-time parameters such as `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `topP` and more.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    ".respond()":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const prediction = model.respond(chat, {
          temperature: 0.6,
          maxTokens: 50,
        });
    ".complete()":
        language: typescript
        code: |
          const prediction = model.complete(prompt, {
            temperature: 0.6,
            maxTokens: 50,
            stop: ["\n\n"],
          });
```

See [`LLMPredictionConfigInput`](./../api-reference/llm-prediction-config-input) for all configurable fields.

Another useful inference-time configuration parameter is [`structured`](<(./structured-responses)>), which allows you to rigorously enforce the structure of the output using a JSON or zod schema.

# Load Parameters

Set load-time parameters such as the context length, GPU offload ratio, and more.

### Set Load Parameters with `.model()`

The `.model()` retrieves a handle to a model that has already been loaded, or loads a new one on demand (JIT loading).

**Note**: if the model is already loaded, the configuration will be **ignored**.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct", {
          config: {
            contextLength: 8192,
            gpu: {
              ratio: 0.5,
            },
          },
        });
```

See [`LLMLoadModelConfig`](./../api-reference/llm-load-model-config) for all configurable fields.

### Set Load Parameters with `.load()`

The `.load()` method creates a new model instance and loads it with the specified configuration.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const model = await client.llm.load("qwen2.5-7b-instruct", {
          config: {
            contextLength: 8192,
            gpu: {
              ratio: 0.5,
            },
          },
        });
```

Speculative decoding is a technique that can substantially increase the generation speed of large language models (LLMs) without reducing response quality. See [Speculative Decoding](./../../app/advanced/speculative-decoding) for more info.

To use speculative decoding in `lmstudio-js`, simply provide a `draftModel` parameter when performing the prediction. You do not need to load the draft model separately.

```lms_code_snippet

        const mainModelKey = "qwen2.5-7b-instruct";
        const draftModelKey = "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct";

        const model = await client.llm.model(mainModelKey);
        const result = await model.respond("What are the prime numbers between 0 and 100?", {
          draftModel: draftModelKey,
        });

        const { content, stats } = result;
        console.info(content);
        console.info(`Accepted ${stats.acceptedDraftTokensCount}/${stats.predictedTokensCount} tokens`);

        const draftModelKey = "qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct";

        const model = await client.llm.model(mainModelKey);
        const prediction = model.respond("What are the prime numbers between 0 and 100?", {
          draftModel: draftModelKey,
        });

        for await (const { content } of prediction) {
          process.stdout.write(content);
        }
        process.stdout.write("\n");

        const { stats } = await prediction.result();
        console.info(`Accepted ${stats.acceptedDraftTokensCount}/${stats.predictedTokensCount} tokens`);

title: Structured Response
description: Enforce a structured response from the model using Pydantic (Python), Zod (TypeScript), or JSON Schema
index: 4
---

You can enforce a particular response format from an LLM by providing a schema (JSON or `zod`) to the `.respond()` method. This guarantees that the model's output conforms to the schema you provide.

## Enforce Using a `zod` Schema

If you wish the model to generate JSON that satisfies a given schema, it is recommended to provide
the schema using [`zod`](https://zod.dev/). When a `zod` schema is provided, the prediction result will contain an extra field `parsed`, which contains parsed, validated, and typed result.

#### Define a `zod` Schema

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

// A zod schema for a book
const bookSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  author: z.string(),
  year: z.number().int(),
});
```

#### Generate a Structured Response

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const result = await model.respond("Tell me about The Hobbit.",
          { structured: bookSchema },
          maxTokens: 100, // Recommended to avoid getting stuck
        );

        const book = result.parsed;
        console.info(book);
        //           ^
        // Note that `book` is now correctly typed as { title: string, author: string, year: number }

    Streaming:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const prediction = model.respond("Tell me about The Hobbit.",
          { structured: bookSchema },
          maxTokens: 100, // Recommended to avoid getting stuck
        );

        for await (const { content } of prediction) {
          process.stdout.write(content);
        }
        process.stdout.write("\n");

        // Get the final structured result
        const result = await prediction.result();
        const book = result.parsed;

        console.info(book);
        //           ^
        // Note that `book` is now correctly typed as { title: string, author: string, year: number }
```

## Enforce Using a JSON Schema

You can also enforce a structured response using a JSON schema.

#### Define a JSON Schema

```ts
// A JSON schema for a book
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    title: { type: "string" },
    author: { type: "string" },
    year: { type: "integer" },
  },
  required: ["title", "author", "year"],
};
```

#### Generate a Structured Response

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Non-streaming":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const result = await model.respond("Tell me about The Hobbit.", {
          structured: {
            type: "json",
            jsonSchema: schema,
          },
          maxTokens: 100, // Recommended to avoid getting stuck
        });

        const book = JSON.parse(result.content);
        console.info(book);
    Streaming:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const prediction = model.respond("Tell me about The Hobbit.", {
          structured: {
            type: "json",
            jsonSchema: schema,
          },
          maxTokens: 100, // Recommended to avoid getting stuck
        });

        for await (const { content } of prediction) {
          process.stdout.write(content);
        }
        process.stdout.write("\n");

        const result = await prediction.result();
        const book = JSON.parse(result.content);

        console.info("Parsed", book);
```

```lms_warning
Structured generation works by constraining the model to only generate tokens that conform to the provided schema. This ensures valid output in normal cases, but comes with two important limitations:

1. Models (especially smaller ones) may occasionally get stuck in an unclosed structure (like an open bracket), when they "forget" they are in such structure and cannot stop due to schema requirements. Thus, it is recommended to always include a `maxTokens` parameter to prevent infinite generation.

2. Schema compliance is only guaranteed for complete, successful generations. If generation is interrupted (by cancellation, reaching the `maxTokens` limit, or other reasons), the output will likely violate the schema. With `zod` schema input, this will raise an error; with JSON schema, you'll receive an invalid string that doesn't satisfy schema.
```

<!-- ## Overview

Once you have [downloaded and loaded](/docs/basics/index) a large language model,
you can use it to respond to input through the API. This article covers getting JSON structured output, but you can also
[request text completions](/docs/api/sdk/completion),
[request chat responses](/docs/api/sdk/chat-completion), and
[use a vision-language model to chat about images](/docs/api/sdk/image-input).

### Usage

Certain models are trained to output valid JSON data that conforms to
a user-provided schema, which can be used programmatically in applications
that need structured data. This structured data format is supported by both
[`complete`](/docs/api/sdk/completion) and [`respond`](/docs/api/sdk/chat-completion)
methods, and relies on Pydantic in Python and Zod in TypeScript.

  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const Book = z.object({
          title: z.string(),
          author: z.string(),
          year: z.number().int()
        })

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const llm = await client.llm.model();

        const response = await llm.respond(
          "Tell me about The Hobbit.",
          { structured: Book },
        )

        console.log(response.content.title)

title: Working with Chats
description: APIs for representing a chat conversation with an LLM
---

SDK methods such as `model.respond()`, `model.applyPromptTemplate()`, or `model.act()`
takes in a chat parameter as an input. There are a few ways to represent a chat in the SDK.

## Option 1: Array of Messages

You can use an array of messages to represent a chat. Here is an example with the `.respond()` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Text-only":
    language: typescript
    code: |
      const prediction = model.respond([
        { role: "system", content: "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
        { role: "user", content: "What is the meaning of life?" },
      ]);
  With Images:
    language: typescript
    code: |
      const image = await client.files.prepareImage("/path/to/image.jpg");

      const prediction = model.respond([
        { role: "system", content: "You are a state-of-art object recognition system." },
        { role: "user", content: "What is this object?", images: [image] },
      ]);
```

## Option 2: Input a Single String

If your chat only has one single user message, you can use a single string to represent the chat. Here is an example with the `.respond` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  TypeScript:
    language: typescript
    code: |
      const prediction = model.respond("What is the meaning of life?");
```

## Option 3: Using the `Chat` Helper Class

For more complex tasks, it is recommended to use the `Chat` helper classes. It provides various commonly used methods to manage the chat. Here is an example with the `Chat` class.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Text-only":
    language: typescript
    code: |
      const chat = Chat.empty();
      chat.append("system", "You are a resident AI philosopher.");
      chat.append("user", "What is the meaning of life?");

      const prediction = model.respond(chat);
  With Images:
    language: typescript
    code: |
      const image = await client.files.prepareImage("/path/to/image.jpg");

      const chat = Chat.empty();
      chat.append("system", "You are a state-of-art object recognition system.");
      chat.append("user", "What is this object?", { images: [image] });

      const prediction = model.respond(chat);
```

You can also quickly construct a `Chat` object using the `Chat.from` method.

```lms_code_snippet
variants:
  "Array of messages":
    language: typescript
    code: |
      const chat = Chat.from([
        { role: "system", content: "You are a resident AI philosopher." },
        { role: "user", content: "What is the meaning of life?" },
      ]);
  "Single string":
    language: typescript
    code: |
      // This constructs a chat with a single user message
      const chat = Chat.from("What is the meaning of life?");
```

title: The `.act()` call
description: How to use the `.act()` call to turn LLMs into autonomous agents that can perform tasks on your local machine.
index: 1
---

## Automatic tool calling

We introduce the concept of execution "rounds" to describe the combined process of running a tool, providing its output to the LLM, and then waiting for the LLM to decide what to do next.

**Execution Round**

```
 • run a tool ->
 ↑   • provide the result to the LLM ->
 │       • wait for the LLM to generate a response
 │
 └────────────────────────────────────────┘ └➔ (return)
```

A model might choose to run tools multiple times before returning a final result. For example, if the LLM is writing code, it might choose to compile or run the program, fix errors, and then run it again, rinse and repeat until it gets the desired result.

With this in mind, we say that the `.act()` API is an automatic "multi-round" tool calling API.


### Quick Example

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient, tool } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const multiplyTool = tool({
          name: "multiply",
          description: "Given two numbers a and b. Returns the product of them.",
          parameters: { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },
          implementation: ({ a, b }) => a * b,
        });

        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");
        await model.act("What is the result of 12345 multiplied by 54321?", [multiplyTool], {
          onMessage: (message) => console.info(message.toString()),
        });
```

### What does it mean for an LLM to "use a tool"?

LLMs are largely text-in, text-out programs. So, you may ask "how can an LLM use a tool?". The answer is that some LLMs are trained to ask the human to call the tool for them, and expect the tool output to to be provided back in some format.

Imagine you're giving computer support to someone over the phone. You might say things like "run this command for me ... OK what did it output? ... OK now click there and tell me what it says ...". In this case you're the LLM! And you're "calling tools" vicariously through the person on the other side of the line.


### Important: Model Selection

The model selected for tool use will greatly impact performance.

Some general guidance when selecting a model:

- Not all models are capable of intelligent tool use
- Bigger is better (i.e., a 7B parameter model will generally perform better than a 3B parameter model)
- We've observed [Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF) to perform well in a wide variety of cases
- This guidance may change

### Example: Multiple Tools

The following code demonstrates how to provide multiple tools in a single `.act()` call.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient, tool } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const additionTool = tool({
          name: "add",
          description: "Given two numbers a and b. Returns the sum of them.",
          parameters: { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },
          implementation: ({ a, b }) => a + b,
        });

        const isPrimeTool = tool({
          name: "isPrime",
          description: "Given a number n. Returns true if n is a prime number.",
          parameters: { n: z.number() },
          implementation: ({ n }) => {
            if (n < 2) return false;
            const sqrt = Math.sqrt(n);
            for (let i = 2; i <= sqrt; i++) {
              if (n % i === 0) return false;
            }
            return true;
          },
        });

        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");
        await model.act(
          "Is the result of 12345 + 45668 a prime? Think step by step.",
          [additionTool, isPrimeTool],
          { onMessage: (message) => console.info(message.toString()) },
        );
```

### Example: Chat Loop with Create File Tool

The following code creates a conversation loop with an LLM agent that can create files.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat, LMStudioClient, tool } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { existsSync } from "fs";
        import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
        import { createInterface } from "readline/promises";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const rl = createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout });
        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();
        const chat = Chat.empty();

        const createFileTool = tool({
          name: "createFile",
          description: "Create a file with the given name and content.",
          parameters: { name: z.string(), content: z.string() },
          implementation: async ({ name, content }) => {
            if (existsSync(name)) {
              return "Error: File already exists.";
            }
            await writeFile(name, content, "utf-8");
            return "File created.";
          },
        });

        while (true) {
          const input = await rl.question("You: ");
          // Append the user input to the chat
          chat.append("user", input);

          process.stdout.write("Bot: ");
          await model.act(chat, [createFileTool], {
            // When the model finish the entire message, push it to the chat
            onMessage: (message) => chat.append(message),
            onPredictionFragment: ({ content }) => {
              process.stdout.write(content);
            },
          });
          process.stdout.write("\n");
        }
```

You can define tools with the `tool()` function and pass them to the model in the `act()` call.

## Anatomy of a Tool

Follow this standard format to define functions as tools:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const exampleTool = tool({
          // The name of the tool
          name: "add",

          // A description of the tool
          description: "Given two numbers a and b. Returns the sum of them.",

          // zod schema of the parameters
          parameters: { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },

          // The implementation of the tool. Just a regular function.
          implementation: ({ a, b }) => a + b,
        });
```

**Important**: The tool name, description, and the parameter definitions are all passed to the model!

This means that your wording will affect the quality of the generation. Make sure to always provide a clear description of the tool so the model knows how to use it.

## Tools with External Effects (like Computer Use or API Calls)

Tools can also have external effects, such as creating files or calling programs and even APIs. By implementing tools with external effects, you
can essentially turn your LLMs into autonomous agents that can perform tasks on your local machine.

## Example: `createFileTool`

### Tool Definition

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "createFileTool.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { existsSync } from "fs";
        import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
        import { z } from "zod";

        const createFileTool = tool({
          name: "createFile",
          description: "Create a file with the given name and content.",
          parameters: { name: z.string(), content: z.string() },
          implementation: async ({ name, content }) => {
            if (existsSync(name)) {
              return "Error: File already exists.";
            }
            await writeFile(name, content, "utf-8");
            return "File created.";
          },
        });
```

### Example code using the `createFile` tool:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { createFileTool } from "./createFileTool";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model("qwen2.5-7b-instruct");
        await model.act(
          "Please create a file named output.txt with your understanding of the meaning of life.",
          [createFileTool],
        );
```

## Add dependencies to your plugin with `npm`

LM Studio plugins supports `npm` packages. You can just install them using `npm install`.

When the plugin is installed, LM Studio will automatically download all the required dependencies that are declared in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. (The user does not need to have Node.js/npm installed.)

### `postinstall` scripts

For safety reasons, we do **not** run `postinstall` scripts. Thus please make sure you are not using any npm packages that require postinstall scripts to work.

## Using Other Package Managers

Since we rely on `package-lock.json`, lock files produced by other package managers will not work. Thus we recommend only using `npm` when developing LM Studio plugins.

Plugins extend LM Studio's functionality by providing "hook functions" that execute at specific points during operation.

Plugins are currently written in JavaScript/TypeScript and run on Node.js v20.18.0. Python support is in development.

## Getting Started

LM Studio includes Node.js, so no separate installation is required.

### Create a new plugin

To create a new plugin, navigate to LM Studio... [TO BE CONTINUED]

### Run a plugin in development mode

Once you've created a plugin, run this command in the plugin directory to start development mode:

```bash
lms dev
```

Your plugin will appear in LM Studio's plugin list. Development mode automatically rebuilds and reloads your plugin when you make code changes.

You only need `lms dev` during development. When the plugin is installed, LM Studio automatically runs them as needed. Learn more about distributing and installing plugins in the [Sharing Plugins](./plugins/sharing) section.

## Next Steps

- [Tools Providers](./plugins/tools-provider)

  Give models extra capabilities by creating tools they can use during generation, like accessing external APIs or performing calculations.

- [Prompt Preprocessors](./plugins/prompt-preprocessor)

  Modify user input before it reaches the model - handle file uploads, inject context, or transform queries.

- [Generators](./plugins/generator)

  Create custom text generation sources that replace the local model, perfect for online model adapters.

- [Custom Configurations](./plugins/custom-configuration)

  Add configuration UIs so users can customize your plugin's behavior.

- [Third-Party Dependencies](./plugins/dependencies)

  Use npm packages to leverage existing libraries in your plugins.

- [Sharing Plugins](./plugins/publish-plugins)

  Package and share your plugins with the community.

```

Tools provider is a function that returns an array of tools that the model can use during generation.

To setup a tools provider, first create the a file `toolsProvider.ts` in your plugin's `src` directory:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool, Tool, ToolsProviderController } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";
        import { existsSync } from "fs";
        import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
        import { join } from "path";

        export async function toolsProvider(ctl: ToolsProviderController) {
          const tools: Tool[] = [];

          const createFileTool = tool({
            // Name of the tool, this will be passed to the model. Aim for concise, descriptive names
            name: `create_file`,
            // Your description here, more details will help the model to understand when to use the tool
            description: "Create a file with the given name and content.",
            parameters: { file_name: z.string(), content: z.string() },
            implementation: async ({ file_name, content }) => {
              const filePath = join(ctl.getWorkingDirectory(), file_name);
              if (existsSync(filePath)) {
                return "Error: File already exists.";
              }
              await writeFile(filePath, content, "utf-8");
              return "File created.";
            },
          });
          tools.push(createFileTool);

          return tools;
        }
```

The above tools provider defines a single tool called `create_file` that allows the model to create a file with a specified name and content inside the working directory. You can learn more about defining tools in [Tool Definition](../agent/tools).

Then register the tools provider in your plugin's `index.ts`:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        // ... other imports ...
        import { toolsProvider } from "./toolsProvider";

        export async function main(context: PluginContext) {
          // ... other plugin setup code ...

          // Register the tools provider.
          context.withToolsProvider(toolsProvider); // <-- Register the tools provider

          // ... other plugin setup code ...
        }
```

Now, you can try to ask the LLM to create a file, and it should be able to do so using the tool you just created.

## Multiple Tools

A tools provider can define multiple tools for the model to use. Simply create additional tool instances and add them to the tools array.

In the example below, we add a second tool to read the content of a file:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool, Tool, ToolsProviderController } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";
        import { existsSync } from "fs";
        import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";
        import { join } from "path";

        export async function toolsProvider(ctl: ToolsProviderController) {
          const tools: Tool[] = [];

          const createFileTool = tool({
            name: `create_file`,
            description: "Create a file with the given name and content.",
            parameters: { file_name: z.string(), content: z.string() },
            implementation: async ({ file_name, content }) => {
              const filePath = join(ctl.getWorkingDirectory(), file_name);
              if (existsSync(filePath)) {
                return "Error: File already exists.";
              }
              await writeFile(filePath, content, "utf-8");
              return "File created.";
            },
          });
          tools.push(createFileTool); // First tool

          const readFileTool = tool({
            name: `read_file`,
            description: "Read the content of a file with the given name.",
            parameters: { file_name: z.string() },
            implementation: async ({ file_name }) => {
              const filePath = join(ctl.getWorkingDirectory(), file_name);
              if (!existsSync(filePath)) {
                return "Error: File does not exist.";
              }
              const content = await readFile(filePath, "utf-8");
              return content;
            },
          });
          tools.push(readFileTool); // Second tool

          return tools; // Return the tools array
        }
```

## Custom Configuration

You can add custom configuration options to your tools provider, so the user of plugin can customize the behavior without modifying the code.

In the example below, we will ask the user to specify a folder name, and we will create files inside that folder within the working directory.

First, add the config field to `config.ts`:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/config.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        export const configSchematics = createConfigSchematics()
          .field(
            "folderName", // Key of the configuration field
            "string", // Type of the configuration field
            {
              displayName: "Folder Name",
              subtitle: "The name of the folder where files will be created.",
            },
            "default_folder", // Default value
          )
          .build();
```

```lms_info
In this example, we added the field to `configSchematics`, which is the "per-chat" configuration. If you want to add a global configuration field that is shared across different chats, you should add it under the section `globalConfigSchematics` in the same file.

Learn more about configurations in [Custom Configurations](../plugins/configurations).
```

Then, modify the tools provider to use the configuration value:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool, Tool, ToolsProviderController } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { existsSync } from "fs";
        import { mkdir, writeFile } from "fs/promises";
        import { join } from "path";
        import { z } from "zod";
        import { configSchematics } from "./config";

        export async function toolsProvider(ctl: ToolsProviderController) {
          const tools: Tool[] = [];

          const createFileTool = tool({
            name: `create_file`,
            description: "Create a file with the given name and content.",
            parameters: { file_name: z.string(), content: z.string() },
            implementation: async ({ file_name, content }) => {
              // Read the config field
              const folderName = ctl.getPluginConfig(configSchematics).get("folderName");
              const folderPath = join(ctl.getWorkingDirectory(), folderName);

              // Ensure the folder exists
              await mkdir(folderPath, { recursive: true });

              // Create the file
              const filePath = join(folderPath, file_name);
              if (existsSync(filePath)) {
                return "Error: File already exists.";
              }
              await writeFile(filePath, content, "utf-8");
              return "File created.";
            },
          });
          tools.push(createFileTool); // First tool

          return tools; // Return the tools array
        }
```

## Status Reports & Warnings

Sometimes, a tool may take a long time to execute. In such cases, it will be helpful to provide status updates, so the user knows what is happening. In order times, you may want to warn the user about potential issues.

You can use `status` and `warn` methods on the second parameter of the tool's implementation function to send status updates and warnings.

The following example shows how to implement a tool that waits for a specified number of seconds, providing status updates and warnings if the wait time exceeds 10 seconds:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool, Tool, ToolsProviderController } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        export async function toolsProvider(ctl: ToolsProviderController) {
          const tools: Tool[] = [];

          const waitTool = tool({
            name: `wait`,
            description: "Wait for a specified number of seconds.",
            parameters: { seconds: z.number().min(1) },
            implementation: async ({ seconds }, { status, warn }) => {
              if (seconds > 10) {
                warn("The model asks to wait for more than 10 seconds.");
              }
              for (let i = 0; i < seconds; i++) {
                status(`Waiting... ${i + 1}/${seconds} seconds`);
                await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
              }
            },
          });
          tools.push(waitTool);

          return tools; // Return the tools array
        }
```

Note status updates and warnings are only visible to the user. If you want the model to also see those messages, you should return them as part of the tool's return value.

## Handling Aborts

A prediction may be aborted by the user while your tool is still running. In such cases, you should handle the abort gracefully by handling the `AbortSignal` object passed as the second parameter to the tool's implementation function.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { tool, Tool, ToolsProviderController } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { z } from "zod";

        export async function toolsProvider(ctl: ToolsProviderController) {
          const tools: Tool[] = [];

          const fetchTool = tool({
            name: `fetch`,
            description: "Fetch a URL using GET method.",
            parameters: { url: z.string() },
            implementation: async ({ url }, { signal }) => {
              const response = await fetch(url, {
                method: "GET",
                signal, // <-- Here, we pass the signal to fetch to allow cancellation
              });
              if (!response.ok) {
                return `Error: Failed to fetch ${url}: ${response.statusText}`;
              }
              const data = await response.text();
              return {
                status: response.status,
                headers: Object.fromEntries(response.headers.entries()),
                data: data.substring(0, 1000), // Limit to 1000 characters
              };
            },
          });
          tools.push(fetchTool);

          return tools;
        }
```

You can learn more about `AbortSignal` in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal).

## Tips

- **Use Descriptive Names and Descriptions**: When defining tools, use descriptive names and detailed descriptions. This helps the model understand when and how to use each tool effectively.
- **Return Errors as Strings**: Sometimes, the model may make a mistake when calling a tool. In such cases, you can return an error message as a string. In most cases, the model will try to correct itself and call the tool again with the correct parameters.

## Examples

The following are some plugins that make use of tools providers:

- [lmstudio/wikipedia](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/wikipedia)

  Gives the LLM tools to search and read Wikipedia articles.

- [lmstudio/js-code-sandbox](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/js-code-sandbox)

  Gives the LLM tools to run JavaScript/TypeScript code in a sandbox environment using [deno](https://deno.com/).

- [lmstudio/dice](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/dice)

  Allows the LLM to generate random numbers using "dice".

title: "Prompt Preprocessors"
description: "Writing prompt preprocessors for LM Studio plugins using TypeScript"
index: 3
---

```lms_private_beta
Plugin support is currently in private beta. [Join the beta here](https://forms.gle/ZPfGLMvVC6DbSRQm9).
```

Prompt Preprocessor is a function that is called upon the user hitting the "Send" button. It receives the user input and can modify it before it reaches the model. If multiple prompt preprocessors are registered, they will be chained together, with each one receiving the output of the previous one.

The modified result will be saved in the chat history, meaning that even if your plugin is disabled afterwards, the modified input will still be used.

Prompt preprocessors will only be triggered for the current user input. It will not be triggered for previous messages in the chat history even if they were not preprocessed.

Prompt preprocessors takes in a `ctl` object for controlling the preprocessing and a `userMessage` it needs to preprocess. It returns either a string or a message object which will replace the user message.

### Example: Inject Current Time

The following is an example preprocessor that injects the current time before each user message.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { type PromptPreprocessorController, type ChatMessage } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        export async function preprocess(ctl: PromptPreprocessorController, userMessage: ChatMessage) {
          const textContent = userMessage.getText();
          const transformed = `Current time: ${new Date().toString()}\n\n${textContent}`;
          return transformed;
        }
```

### Example: Replace Trigger Words

Another example you can do it with simple text only processing is by replacing certain trigger words. For example, you can replace a `@init` trigger with a special initialization message.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { type PromptPreprocessorController, type ChatMessage, text } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const mySpecialInstructions = text`
          Here are some special instructions...
        `;

        export async function preprocess(ctl: PromptPreprocessorController, userMessage: ChatMessage) {
          const textContent = userMessage.getText();
          const transformed = textContent.replaceAll("@init", mySpecialInstructions);
          return transformed;
        }
```

### Custom Configurations

You can access custom configurations via `ctl.getPluginConfig` and `ctl.getGlobalPluginConfig`. See [Custom Configurations](./configurations) for more details.

The following is an example of how you can make the `specialInstructions` and `triggerWord` configurable:

First, add the config field to `config.ts`:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/config.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { createConfigSchematics } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        export const configSchematics = createConfigSchematics()
          .field(
            "specialInstructions",
            "string",
            {
              displayName: "Special Instructions",
              subtitle: "Special instructions to be injected when the trigger word is found.",
            },
            "Here is some default special instructions.",
          )
          .field(
            "triggerWord",
            "string",
            {
              displayName: "Trigger Word",
              subtitle: "The word that will trigger the special instructions.",
            },
            "@init",
          )
          .build();
```

```lms_info
In this example, we added the field to `configSchematics`, which is the "per-chat" configuration. If you want to add a global configuration field that is shared across different chats, you should add it under the section `globalConfigSchematics` in the same file.

Learn more about configurations in [Custom Configurations](../plugins/configurations).

Then, modify the prompt preprocessor to use the configuration:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { type PromptPreprocessorController, type ChatMessage } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { configSchematics } from "./config";

        export async function preprocess(ctl: PromptPreprocessorController, userMessage: ChatMessage) {
          const textContent = userMessage.getText();
          const pluginConfig = ctl.getPluginConfig(configSchematics);

          const triggerWord = pluginConfig.get("triggerWord");
          const specialInstructions = pluginConfig.get("specialInstructions");

          const transformed = textContent.replaceAll(triggerWord, specialInstructions);
          return transformed;
        }
```

### Custom Status Reporting

Depending on the task, the prompt preprocessor may take some time to complete, for example, it may need to fetch some data from the internet or perform some heavy computation. In such cases, you can report the status of the preprocessing using `ctl.setStatus`.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const status = ctl.createStatus({
          status: "loading",
          text: "Preprocessing.",
        });
```

You can update the status at any time by calling `status.setState`.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        status.setState({
          status: "done",
          text: "Preprocessing done.",
        })
```

You can even add sub status to the status:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const subStatus = status.addSubStatus({
          status: "loading",
          text: "I am a sub status."
        });
```

## Handling Aborts

A prediction may be aborted by the user while your generator is still running. In such cases, you should handle the abort gracefully by handling the `ctl.abortSignal`.

You can learn more about `AbortSignal` in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal).

### Examples

The following are some plugins that make use of prompt preprocessors:

- [lmstudio/rag-v1](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/rag-v1)

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for LM Studio. This is the plugin that gives document handling capabilities to LM Studio.

```

Generators are replacement for local LLMs. They act like a token source. When a plugin with a generator is used, LM Studio will no longer use the local model to generate text. The generator will be used instead.

Generators are useful for implementing adapters for external models, such as using a remote LM Studio instance or other online models.

If a plugin contains a generator, it will no longer show up in the plugins list. Instead, it will show up in the model dropdown and act as a model. If your plugins contains [Tools Provider](./tools-providers.md) or [Prompt Preprocessor](./prompt-preprocessors.md), they will be used when your generator is being selected.

## Text-Only Generators

Generators take in the the generator controller and the current conversation state, start the generation, and then report the generated text using the `ctl.fragmentGenerated` method.

The following is an example of a simple generator that echos back the last user message with 200 ms delay between each word:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat, GeneratorController } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        export async function generate(ctl: GeneratorController, chat: Chat) {
          // Just echo back the last message
          const lastMessage = chat.at(-1).getText();
          // Split the last message into words
          const words = lastMessage.split(/(?= )/);
          for (const word of words) {
            ctl.fragmentGenerated(word); // Send each word as a fragment
            ctl.abortSignal.throwIfAborted(); // Allow for cancellation
            await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200)); // Simulate some processing time
          }
        }
```

## Tool Call Support for Generators

To enable tool use, it is slightly more involved. Too see a comprehensive example that adapts OpenAI API, see the [openai-compat-endpoint plugin](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/openai-compat-endpoint).

You can read the definition of tools available using `ctl.getToolDefinitions()`. For example, if you are making an online model adapter, you need to pass the tool definition to the model.

Once the model starts to make tool calls, you need to tell LM Studio about those calls.

Use `ctl.toolCallGenerationStarted` to report the start of a tool call generation (i.e. the model starts to generate a tool call).

Use `ctl.toolCallGenerationEnded` to report a successful generation of a tool call or use `ctl.toolCallGenerationFailed` to report a failed generation of a tool call.

Optionally, you can also `ctl.toolCallGenerationNameReceived` to eagerly report the name of the tool being called once that is available. You can also use `ctl.toolCallGenerationArgumentFragmentGenerated` to report fragments of the tool call arguments as they are generated. These two methods are useful for providing better user experience, but are not strictly necessary.

Overall, your generator must call these ctl methods in the following order:

1. 0 - N calls to `ctk.fragmentGenerated` to report the generated non-tool-call text fragments.
2. For each tool call:
   1. Call `ctl.toolCallGenerationStarted` to indicate the start of a tool call generation.
   2. (Optionally) Call `ctl.toolCallGenerationNameReceived` to report the name of the tool being called.
   3. (Optionally) Call any times of `ctl.toolCallGenerationArgumentFragmentGenerated` to report the generated fragments of the tool call arguments.
   4. Call either `ctl.toolCallGenerationEnded` to report a successful generation of the tool call or `ctl.toolCallGenerationFailed` to report a failed generation of the tool call.
   5. If the model generates more text between/after the tool call, 0 - N calls to `ctl.fragmentGenerated` to report the generated non-tool-call text fragments. (This should not happen normally, but it is technically possible for some smaller models to do this. **Critically: this is not the same as model receiving the tool results and continuing the conversation. This is just model refusing to stop talking after made a tool request - the tool result is not available to the model yet.** When multi-round prediction happens, i.e. the model actually receives the tool call, your generator function will be called again with the updated conversation state.)

Some API formats may report the tool name together with the beginning of the tool call generation, in which case you can call `ctl.toolCallGenerationNameReceived` immediately after `ctl.toolCallGenerationStarted`.

Some API formats may not have incremental tool call updates (i.e. the entire tool call request is given at once), in which case you can just call `ctl.toolCallGenerationStarted` then immediately `ctl.toolCallGenerationEnded`.

## Custom Configurations

You can access custom configurations via `ctl.getPluginConfig` and `ctl.getGlobalPluginConfig`. See [Custom Configurations](./configurations) for more details.

## Handling Aborts

A prediction may be aborted by the user while your generator is still running. In such cases, you should handle the abort gracefully by handling the `ctl.abortSignal`.

You can learn more about `AbortSignal` in the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal).

## Examples

The following are some plugins that make use of generators:

- [lmstudio/remote-lmstudio](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/remote-lmstudio)

  Basic support for using a remote LM Studio instance to generate text.

- [lmstudio/openai-compat-endpoint](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/openai-compat-endpoint)

  Use any OpenAI-compatible API in LM Studio.

```

## Overview

LM Studio plugins support custom configurations. That is, you can define a configuration schema and LM Studio will present a UI to the user so they can configure your plugin without having to edit any code.

There are two types of configurations:

- **Per-chat configuration**: tied to a specific chat. Different chats can have different configurations. Most configurations that affects the behavior of the plugin should be of this type.
- **Global configuration**: apply to _all_ chats and are shared across the application. This is useful for global settings such as API keys.

## Types of Configurations

You can define configurations in TypeScript using the `createConfigSchematics` function from the `@lmstudio/sdk` package. This function allows you to define fields with various types and options.

Supported types include:

- `string`: A text input field.
- `numeric`: A number input field with optional validation and slider UI.
- `boolean`: A checkbox or toggle input field.
- `stringArray`: An array of string values with configurable constraints.
- `select`: A dropdown selection field with predefined options.

See the [Defining New Fields](#defining-new-fields) section for more details on how to define these fields.

## The `config.ts` File

By default, the plugin scaffold will create a `config.ts` file in the `src/` directory which will contain the schematics of the configurations. If the files does not exist, you can create it manually:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/toolsProvider.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { createConfigSchematics } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        export const configSchematics = createConfigSchematics()
          .field(
            "myCustomField", // The key of the field.
            "numeric", // Type of the field.
            // Options for the field. Different field types will have different options.
            {
              displayName: "My Custom Field",
              hint: "This is my custom field. Doesn't do anything special.",
              slider: { min: 0, max: 100, step: 1 }, // Add a slider to the field.
            },
            80, // Default Value
          )
          // You can add more fields by chaining the field method.
          // For example:
          //   .field("anotherField", ...)
          .build();

        export const globalConfigSchematics = createConfigSchematics()
          .field(
            "myGlobalCustomField", // The key of the field.
            "string",
            {
              displayName: "My Global Custom Field",
              hint: "This is my global custom field. Doesn't do anything special.",
            },
            "default value", // Default Value
          )
          // You can add more fields by chaining the field method.
          // For example:
          //  .field("anotherGlobalField", ...)
          .build();
```

If you've added your config schematics manuall, you will also need to register the configurations in your plugin's `index.ts` file.

This is done by calling `context.withConfigSchematics(configSchematics)` and `context.withGlobalConfigSchematics(globalConfigSchematics)` in the `main` function of your plugin.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        // ... other imports ...
        import { toolsProvider } from "./toolsProvider";

        export async function main(context: PluginContext) {
          // ... other plugin setup code ...

          // Register the configuration schematics.
          context.withConfigSchematics(configSchematics);
          // Register the global configuration schematics.
          context.withGlobalConfigSchematics(globalConfigSchematics);

          // ... other plugin setup code ...
        }
```

## Accessing Configurations

You can access the configuration using the method `ctl.getPluginConfig(configSchematics)` and `ctl.getGlobalConfig(globalConfigSchematics)` respectively.

For example, here is how to access the config within the promptPreprocessor:

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "src/promptPreprocessor.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { type PreprocessorController, type ChatMessage } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        import { configSchematics } from "./config";

        export async function preprocess(ctl: PreprocessorController, userMessage: ChatMessage) {
          const pluginConfig = ctl.getPluginConfig(configSchematics);
          const myCustomField = pluginConfig.get("myCustomField");

          const globalPluginConfig = ctl.getGlobalPluginConfig(configSchematics);
          const globalMyCustomField = globalPluginConfig.get("myCustomField");

          return (
            `${userMessage.getText()},` +
            `myCustomField: ${myCustomField}, ` +
            `globalMyCustomField: ${globalMyCustomField}`
          );
        }
```

## Defining New Fields

We support the following field types:

- `string`: A text input field.

  ```lms_code_snippet
    variants:
      TypeScript:
        language: typescript
        code: |
          // ... other fields ...
          .field(
            "stringField", // The key of the field.
            "string", // Type of the field.
            {
              displayName: "A string field",
              subtitle: "Subtitle", // Optional subtitle for the field. (Show below the field)
              hint: "Hint", // Optional hint for the field. (Show on hover)
              isParagraph: false, // Whether to show a large text input area for this field.
              isProtected: false, // Whether the value should be obscured in the UI (e.g., for passwords).
              placeholder: "Placeholder text", // Optional placeholder text for the field.
            },
            "default value", // Default Value
          )
          // ... other fields ...
  ```

- `numeric`: A number input field with optional validation and slider UI.

  ```lms_code_snippet
    variants:
      TypeScript:
        language: typescript
        code: |
          // ... other fields ...
          .field(
            "numberField", // The key of the field.
            "numeric", // Type of the field.
            {
              displayName: "A number field",
              subtitle: "Subtitle for", // Optional subtitle for the field. (Show below the field)
              hint: "Hint for number field", // Optional hint for the field. (Show on hover)
              int: false, // Whether the field should accept only integer values.
              min: 0, // Minimum value for the field.
              max: 100, // Maximum value for the field.
              slider: {
                // If present, configurations for the slider UI
                min: 0, // Minimum value for the slider.
                max: 100, // Maximum value for the slider.
                step: 1, // Step value for the slider.
              },
            },
            42, // Default Value
          )
          // ... other fields ...
  ```

- `boolean`: A checkbox or toggle input field.

  ```lms_code_snippet
    variants:
      TypeScript:
        language: typescript
        code: |
          // ... other fields ...
          .field(
            "booleanField", // The key of the field.
            "boolean", // Type of the field.
            {
              displayName: "A boolean field",
              subtitle: "Subtitle", // Optional subtitle for the field. (Show below the field)
              hint: "Hint", // Optional hint for the field. (Show on hover)
            },
            true, // Default Value
          )
          // ... other fields ...
  ```

- `stringArray`: An array of string values with configurable constraints.

  ```lms_code_snippet
    variants:
      TypeScript:
        language: typescript
        code: |
          // ... other fields ...
          .field(
            "stringArrayField",
            "stringArray",
            {
              displayName: "A string array field",
              subtitle: "Subtitle", // Optional subtitle for the field. (Show below the field)
              hint: "Hint", // Optional hint for the field. (Show on hover)
              allowEmptyStrings: true, // Whether to allow empty strings in the array.
              maxNumItems: 5, // Maximum number of items in the array.
            },
            ["default", "values"], // Default Value
          )
          // ... other fields ...
  ```

- `select`: A dropdown selection field with predefined options.

  ```lms_code_snippet
    variants:
      TypeScript:
        language: typescript
        code: |
          // ... other fields ...
          .field(
            "selectField",
            "select",
            {
              displayName: "A select field",
              options: [
                { value: "option1", displayName: "Option 1" },
                { value: "option2", displayName: "Option 2" },
                { value: "option3", displayName: "Option 3" },
              ],
              subtitle: "Subtitle", // Optional subtitle for the field. (Show below the field)
              hint: "Hint", // Optional hint for the field. (Show on hover)
            },
            "option1", // Default Value
          )
          // ... other fields ...
  ```

## Examples

The following are some plugins that make use of custom configurations

- [lmstudio/wikipedia](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/wikipedia)

  Gives the LLM tools to search and read Wikipedia articles.

- [lmstudio/openai-compat-endpoint](https://lmstudio.ai/lmstudio/openai-compat-endpoint)

  Use any OpenAI-compatible API in LM Studio.

title: "Sharing Plugins"
description: "How to publish your LM Studio plugins so they can be used by others"
index: 7
---

```lms_private_beta
Plugin support is currently in private beta. [Join the beta here](https://forms.gle/ZPfGLMvVC6DbSRQm9).
```

To share publish your LM Studio plugin, open the plugin directory in a terminal and run:

```bash
lms push
```

This command will package your plugin and upload it to the LM Studio Hub. You can use this command to create new plugins or update existing ones.

### Changing Plugin Names

If you wish to change the name of the plugin, you can do so by editing the `manifest.json` file in the root of your plugin directory. Look for the `name` field and update it to your desired plugin name. Note the `name` must be kebab-case.

When you `lms push` the plugin, it will be treated as a new plugin if the name has changed. You can delete the old plugin from the LM Studio Hub if you no longer need it.

### Publishing Plugins to an Organization

If you are in an organization and wish to publish the plugin to the organization, you can do so by editing the `manifest.json` file in the root of your plugin directory. Look for the `owner` field and set it to the name of your organization. When you run `lms push`, the plugin will be published to the organization instead of your personal account.

### Private Plugins

If your account supports private plugins, you can publish your plugins privately by using the `--private` flag when running `lms push`:

```bash
lms push --private
```

Private artifact is in test. Get in touch if you are interested.



================================================
FILE: 2_typescript/4_embedding/index.md
================================================

title: Embedding
sidebar_title: Generating embedding vectors
description: Generate text embeddings from input text
---

Generate embeddings for input text. Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Embeddings are a building block for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and other similarity-based tasks.

### Prerequisite: Get an Embedding Model

If you don't yet have an embedding model, you can download a model like `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` using the following command:

```bash
lms get nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
```

## Create Embeddings

To convert a string to a vector representation, pass it to the `embed` method on the corresponding embedding model handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.embedding.model("nomic-embed-text-v1.5");

        const { embedding } = await model.embed("Hello, world!");
```



================================================
FILE: 2_typescript/5_tokenization/index.md
================================================
---
title: Tokenization
sidebar_title: Tokenizing text
description: Tokenize text using a model's tokenizer
---

Models use a tokenizer to internally convert text into "tokens" they can deal with more easily. LM Studio exposes this tokenizer for utility.

## Tokenize

You can tokenize a string with a loaded LLM or embedding model using the SDK. In the below examples, `llm` can be replaced with an embedding model `emb`.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();

        const tokens = await model.tokenize("Hello, world!");

        console.info(tokens); // Array of token IDs.
```

## Count tokens

If you only care about the number of tokens, you can use the `.countTokens` method instead.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const tokenCount = await model.countTokens("Hello, world!");
        console.info("Token count:", tokenCount);
```

### Example: Count Context

You can determine if a given conversation fits into a model's context by doing the following:

1. Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
2. Count the number of tokens in the string.
3. Compare the token count to the model's context length.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat, type LLM, LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        async function doesChatFitInContext(model: LLM, chat: Chat) {
          // Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
          const formatted = await model.applyPromptTemplate(chat);
          // Count the number of tokens in the string.
          const tokenCount = await model.countTokens(formatted);
          // Get the current loaded context length of the model
          const contextLength = await model.getContextLength();
          return tokenCount < contextLength;
        }

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();

        const chat = Chat.from([
          { role: "user", content: "What is the meaning of life." },
          { role: "assistant", content: "The meaning of life is..." },
          // ... More messages
        ]);

        console.info("Fits in context:", await doesChatFitInContext(model, chat));

<!-- ### Context length comparisons

The below examples check whether a conversation is over a LLM's context length
(replace `llm` with `emb` to check for an embedding model).

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient, Chat } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const llm = await client.llm.model();

        // To check for a string, simply tokenize
        var tokens = await llm.tokenize("Hello, world!");

        // To check for a Chat, apply the prompt template first
        const chat = Chat.createEmpty().withAppended("user", "Hello, world!");
        const templatedChat = await llm.applyPromptTemplate(chat);
        tokens = await llm.tokenize(templatedChat);

        // If the prompt's length in tokens is less than the context length, you're good!
        const contextLength = await llm.getContextLength()
        const isOkay = (tokens.length < contextLength)

title: Download Models
description: Download models to the machine running the LM Studio server
---

## Overview

You can browse and download models using the LM Studio SDK just like you would
in the Discover tab of the app itself. Once a model is downloaded, you can
[load it](/docs/api/sdk/load-and-access-models) for inference.

### Usage

Downloading models consists of three steps:

1. Search for the model you want;
2. Find the download option you want (e.g. quantization); and
3. Download the model!

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        // 1. Search for the model you want
        // Specify any/all of searchTerm, limit, compatibilityTypes
        const searchResults = await client.repository.searchModels({
          searchTerm: "llama 3.2 1b",    // Search for Llama 3.2 1B
          limit: 5,                      // Get top 5 results
          compatibilityTypes: ["gguf"],  // Only download GGUFs
        });

        // 2. Find download options
        const bestResult = searchResults[0];
        const downloadOptions = await bestResult.getDownloadOptions();

        // Let's download Q4_K_M, a good middle ground quantization
        const desiredModel = downloadOptions.find(option => option.quantization === 'Q4_K_M');

        // 3. Download it!
        const modelKey = await desiredModel.download();

        // This returns a path you can use to load the model
        const loadedModel = await client.llm.model(modelKey);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Progress callbacks

TODO: TS/python differ in callback names

Model downloading can take a very long time, depending on your local network speed.
If you want to get updates on the progress of this process, you can provide callbacks to `download`:
one for progress updates and/or one when the download is being finalized
(validating checksums, etc.)

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    Python (with scoped resources):
      language: python
      code: |
        import lmstudio

        def print_progress_update(update: lmstudio.DownloadProgressUpdate) -> None:
            print(f"Downloaded {update.downloaded_bytes} bytes of {update.total_bytes} total \
                    at {update.speed_bytes_per_second} bytes/sec")

        with lmstudio.Client() as client:
            # ... Same code as before ...

            model_key = desired_model.download(
                on_progress=print_progress_update,
                on_finalize: lambda: print("Finalizing download...")
            )

    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient, type DownloadProgressUpdate } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        function printProgressUpdate(update: DownloadProgressUpdate) {
          process.stdout.write(`Downloaded ${update.downloadedBytes} bytes of ${update.totalBytes} total \
                                at ${update.speed_bytes_per_second} bytes/sec`);
        }

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        // ... Same code as before ...

        modelKey = await desiredModel.download({
          onProgress: printProgressUpdate,
          onStartFinalizing: () => console.log("Finalizing..."),
        });

        const loadedModel = await client.llm.model(modelKey);
```



================================================
FILE: 2_typescript/6_manage-models/list-downloaded.md
================================================
---
title: List Local Models
description: APIs to list the available models in a given local environment
---

You can iterate through locally available models using the `listLocalModels` method.

## Available Model on the Local Machine

`listLocalModels` lives under the `system` namespace of the `LMStudioClient` object.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        console.info(await client.system.listDownloadedModels());
```

This will give you results equivalent to using [`lms ls`](../../cli/ls) in the CLI.

### Example output:

```json

  {
    "type": "llm",
    "modelKey": "qwen2.5-7b-instruct",
    "format": "gguf",

---
title: List Loaded Models
description: Query which models are currently loaded
---

You can iterate through models loaded into memory using the `listLoaded` method. This method lives under the `llm` and `embedding` namespaces of the `LMStudioClient` object.

## List Models Currently Loaded in Memory

This will give you results equivalent to using [`lms ps`](../../cli/ps) in the CLI.

FILE: 2_typescript/6_manage-models/loading.md
================================================
---
title: "Manage Models in Memory"
sidebar_title: Load and Access Models
description: APIs to load, access, and unload models from memory
---

AI models are huge. It can take a while to load them into memory. LM Studio's SDK allows you to precisely control this process.

**Most commonly:**

- Use `.model()` to get any currently loaded model
- Use `.model("model-key")` to use a specific model

**Advanced (manual model management):**

- Use `.load("model-key")` to load a new instance of a model
- Use `model.unload()` to unload a model from memory

## Get the Current Model with `.model()`

If you already have a model loaded in LM Studio (either via the GUI or `lms load`), you can use it by calling `.model()` without any arguments.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model();
```

## Get a Specific Model with `.model("model-key")`

If you want to use a specific model, you can provide the model key as an argument to `.model()`.

#### Get if Loaded, or Load if not

Calling `.model("model-key")` will load the model if it's not already loaded, or return the existing instance if it is.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model("llama-3.2-1b-instruct");
```

<!-- Learn more about the `.model()` method and the parameters it accepts in the [API Reference](../api-reference/model). -->

## Load a New Instance of a Model with `.load()`

Use `load()` to load a new instance of a model, even if one already exists. This allows you to have multiple instances of the same or different models loaded at the same time.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";
        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const llama = await client.llm.load("llama-3.2-1b-instruct");
        const another_llama = await client.llm.load("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", {
          identifier: "second-llama"
        });
```

<!-- Learn more about the `.load()` method and the parameters it accepts in the [API Reference](../api-reference/load). -->

### Note about Instance Identifiers

If you provide an instance identifier that already exists, the server will throw an error.
So if you don't really care, it's safer to not provide an identifier, in which case
the server will generate one for you. You can always check in the server tab in LM Studio, too!

## Unload a Model from Memory with `.unload()`

Once you no longer need a model, you can unload it by simply calling `unload()` on its handle.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model();
        await model.unload();
```

## Set Custom Load Config Parameters

You can also specify the same load-time configuration options when loading a model, such as Context Length and GPU offload.

See [load-time configuration](../llm-prediction/parameters) for more.

## Set an Auto Unload Timer (TTL)

You can specify a _time to live_ for a model you load, which is the idle time (in seconds)
after the last request until the model unloads. See [Idle TTL](/docs/api/ttl-and-auto-evict) for more on this.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    "Using .load":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.load("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", {
          ttl: 300, // 300 seconds
        });
    "Using .model":
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();

        const model = await client.llm.model("llama-3.2-1b-instruct", {
          // Note: specifying ttl in `.model` will only set the TTL for the model if the model is
          // loaded from this call. If the model was already loaded, the TTL will not be updated.
          ttl: 300, // 300 seconds
        });

### Parameters

```lms_params
- name: gpu
  description: |
    How to distribute the work to your GPUs. See {@link GPUSetting} for more information.
  public: true
  type: GPUSetting
  optional: true

- name: contextLength
  description: |
    The size of the context length in number of tokens. This will include both the prompts and the
    responses. Once the context length is exceeded, the value set in
    {@link LLMPredictionConfigBase#contextOverflowPolicy} is used to determine the behavior.

    See {@link LLMContextOverflowPolicy} for more information.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: ropeFrequencyBase
  description: |
    Custom base frequency for rotary positional embeddings (RoPE).

    This advanced parameter adjusts how positional information is embedded in the model's
    representations. Increasing this value may enable better performance at high context lengths by
    modifying how the model processes position-dependent information.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: ropeFrequencyScale
  description: |
    Scaling factor for RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding) frequency.

    This factor scales the effective context window by modifying how positional information is
    encoded. Higher values allow the model to handle longer contexts by making positional encoding
    more granular, which can be particularly useful for extending a model beyond its original
    training context length.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: evalBatchSize
  description: |
    Number of input tokens to process together in a single batch during evaluation.

    Increasing this value typically improves processing speed and throughput by leveraging
    parallelization, but requires more memory. Finding the optimal batch size often involves
    balancing between performance gains and available hardware resources.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: flashAttention
  description: |
    Enables Flash Attention for optimized attention computation.

    Flash Attention is an efficient implementation that reduces memory usage and speeds up
    generation by optimizing how attention mechanisms are computed. This can significantly
    improve performance on compatible hardware, especially for longer sequences.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: keepModelInMemory
  description: |
    When enabled, prevents the model from being swapped out of system memory.

    This option reserves system memory for the model even when portions are offloaded to GPU,
    ensuring faster access times when the model needs to be used. Improves performance
    particularly for interactive applications, but increases overall RAM requirements.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: seed
  description: |
    Random seed value for model initialization to ensure reproducible outputs.

    Setting a specific seed ensures that random operations within the model (like sampling)
    produce the same results across different runs, which is important for reproducibility
    in testing and development scenarios.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: useFp16ForKVCache
  description: |
    When enabled, stores the key-value cache in half-precision (FP16) format.

    This option significantly reduces memory usage during inference by using 16-bit floating
    point numbers instead of 32-bit for the attention cache. While this may slightly reduce
    numerical precision, the impact on output quality is generally minimal for most applications.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: tryMmap
  description: |
    Attempts to use memory-mapped (mmap) file access when loading the model.

    Memory mapping can improve initial load times by mapping model files directly from disk to
    memory, allowing the operating system to handle paging. This is particularly beneficial for
    quick startup, but may reduce performance if the model is larger than available system RAM,
    causing frequent disk access.
  type: boolean
  optional: true

- name: numExperts
  description: |
    Specifies the number of experts to use for models with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture.

    MoE models contain multiple "expert" networks that specialize in different aspects of the task.
    This parameter controls how many of these experts are active during inference, affecting both
    performance and quality of outputs. Only applicable for models designed with the MoE architecture.
  type: number
  optional: true

- name: llamaKCacheQuantizationType
  description: |
    Quantization type for the Llama model's key cache.

    This option determines the precision level used to store the key component of the attention
    mechanism's cache. Lower precision values (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit quantization) significantly
    reduce memory usage during inference but may slightly impact output quality. The effect varies
    between different models, with some being more robust to quantization than others.

    Set to false to disable quantization and use full precision.
  type: LLMLlamaCacheQuantizationType | false
  optional: true

- name: llamaVCacheQuantizationType
  description: |
    Quantization type for the Llama model's value cache.

    Similar to the key cache quantization, this option controls the precision used for the value
    component of the attention mechanism's cache. Reducing precision saves memory but may affect
    generation quality. This option requires Flash Attention to be enabled to function properly.

    Different models respond differently to value cache quantization, so experimentation may be
    needed to find the optimal setting for a specific use case. Set to false to disable quantization.
  type: LLMLlamaCacheQuantizationType | false
  optional: true
```

title: Get Load Config
description: Get the load configuration of the model
---

LM Studio allows you to configure certain parameters when loading a model
[through the server UI](/docs/advanced/per-model) or [through the API](/docs/api/sdk/load-model).

You can retrieve the config with which a given model was loaded using the SDK. In the below examples, `llm` can be replaced with an embedding model `emb`.

```lms_protip
Context length is a special case that [has its own method](/docs/api/sdk/get-context-length).
```

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();

        loadConfig = await model.getLoadConfig()
```



================================================
FILE: 2_typescript/8_model-info/get-context-length.md
================================================
---
title: Get Context Length
description: API to get the maximum context length of a model.
---

LLMs and embedding models, due to their fundamental architecture, have a property called `context length`, and more specifically a **maximum** context length. Loosely speaking, this is how many tokens the models can "keep in memory" when generating text or embeddings. Exceeding this limit will result in the model behaving erratically.

## Use the `getContextLength()` Function on the Model Object

It's useful to be able to check the context length of a model, especially as an extra check before providing potentially long input to the model.

```lms_code_snippet
  title: "index.ts"
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        const contextLength = await model.getContextLength();
```

The `model` in the above code snippet is an instance of a loaded model you get from the `llm.model` method. See [Manage Models in Memory](../manage-models/loading) for more information.

### Example: Check if the input will fit in the model's context window

You can determine if a given conversation fits into a model's context by doing the following:

1. Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
2. Count the number of tokens in the string.
3. Compare the token count to the model's context length.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat, type LLM, LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        async function doesChatFitInContext(model: LLM, chat: Chat) {
          // Convert the conversation to a string using the prompt template.
          const formatted = await model.applyPromptTemplate(chat);
          // Count the number of tokens in the string.
          const tokenCount = await model.countTokens(formatted);
          // Get the current loaded context length of the model
          const contextLength = await model.getContextLength();
          return tokenCount < contextLength;
        }

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const model = await client.llm.model();

        const chat = Chat.from([
          { role: "user", content: "What is the meaning of life." },
          { role: "assistant", content: "The meaning of life is..." },
          // ... More messages
        ]);

        console.info("Fits in context:", await doesChatFitInContext(model, chat));
```

================================================
---
title: Get Model Info
description: Get information about the model

You can access information about a loaded model using the `getInfo` method.

```lms_code_snippet

FILE: 2_typescript/_more/_apply-prompt-template.md
================================================
---
title: Apply Prompt Template
description: Apply a model's prompt template to a conversation
---

## Overview

LLMs (Large Language Models) operate on a text-in, text-out basis. Before processing conversations through these models, the input must be converted into a properly formatted string using a prompt template. If you need to inspect or work with this formatted string directly, the LM Studio SDK provides a streamlined way to apply a model's prompt template to your conversations.

```lms_info
You do not need to use this method when using `.respond`. It will automatically apply the prompt template for you.
```

## Usage with a Chat

You can apply a prompt template to a `Chat` by using the `applyPromptTemplate` method. This method takes a `Chat` object as input and returns a formatted string.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { Chat, LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const llm = await client.llm.model(); // Use any loaded LLM

        const chat = Chat.createEmpty();
        chat.append("system", "You are a helpful assistant.");
        chat.append("user", "What is LM Studio?");
        const formatted = await llm.applyPromptTemplate(chat);
        console.info(formatted);
```

## Usage with an Array of Messages

The same method can also be used with any object that can be converted to a `Chat`, for example, an array of messages.

```lms_code_snippet
  variants:
    TypeScript:
      language: typescript
      code: |
        import { LMStudioClient } from "@lmstudio/sdk";

        const client = new LMStudioClient();
        const llm = await client.llm.model(); // Use any loaded LLM

        const formatted = await llm.applyPromptTemplate([
          { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
          { role: "user", content: "What is LM Studio?" },
        ]);
        console.info(formatted);
```

sidebar_title: "Introduction"
description: Get starting with the `lms` command line utility.
index: 1
---

LM Studio ships with `lms`, a command line tool for scripting and automating your local LLM workflows.

`lms` is **MIT Licensed** and is developed in this repository on GitHub: https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lms

<hr>

```lms_info
👉 You need to run LM Studio _at least once_ before you can use `lms`.
```

### Install `lms`

`lms` ships with LM Studio and can be found under `/bin` in the LM Studio's working directory.

Use the following commands to add `lms` to your system path.

#### Bootstrap `lms` on macOS or Linux

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
~/.lmstudio/bin/lms bootstrap
```

#### Bootstrap `lms` on Windows

Run the following command in **PowerShell**:

```shell
cmd /c %USERPROFILE%/.lmstudio/bin/lms.exe bootstrap
```

#### Verify the installation

Open a **new terminal window** and run `lms`.

This is the current output you will get:

```bash
$ lms
lms - LM Studio CLI - v0.2.22
GitHub: https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-cli

Usage
lms <subcommand>

where <subcommand> can be one of:

- status - Prints the status of LM Studio
- server - Commands for managing the local server
- ls - List all downloaded models
- ps - List all loaded models
- load - Load a model
- unload - Unload a model
- create - Create a new project with scaffolding
- log - Log operations. Currently only supports streaming logs from LM Studio via `lms log stream`
- version - Prints the version of the CLI
- bootstrap - Bootstrap the CLI

For more help, try running `lms <subcommand> --help`
```

### Use `lms` to automate and debug your workflows

### Start and stop the local server

```bash
lms server start
lms server stop
```

### List the local models on the machine

```bash
lms ls
```

This will reflect the current LM Studio models directory, which you set in **📂 My Models** tab in the app.

### List the currently loaded models

```bash
lms ps
```

### Load a model (with options)

```bash
lms load [--gpu=max|auto|0.0-1.0] [--context-length=1-N]
```

`--gpu=1.0` means 'attempt to offload 100% of the computation to the GPU'.

- Optionally, assign an identifier to your local LLM:

```bash
lms load TheBloke/phi-2-GGUF --identifier="gpt-4-turbo"
```

This is useful if you want to keep the model identifier consistent.

### Unload models

```
lms unload [--all]
```

---

The `lms load` command loads a model into memory. You can optionally set parameters such as context length, GPU offload, and TTL.

### Parameters 
```lms_params
- name: "[path]"
  type: "string"
  optional: true
  description: "The path of the model to load. If not provided, you will be prompted to select one"
- name: "--ttl"
  type: "number"
  optional: true
  description: "If provided, when the model is not used for this number of seconds, it will be unloaded"
- name: "--gpu"
  type: "string"
  optional: true
  description: "How much to offload to the GPU. Values: 0-1, off, max"
- name: "--context-length"
  type: "number"
  optional: true
  description: "The number of tokens to consider as context when generating text"
- name: "--identifier"
  type: "string"
  optional: true
  description: "The identifier to assign to the loaded model for API reference"
```

## Load a model

Load a model into memory by running the following command:

```shell
lms load <model_key>
```

You can find the `model_key` by first running [`lms ls`](/docs/cli/ls) to list your locally downloaded models.

### Set a custom identifier

Optionally, you can assign a custom identifier to the loaded model for API reference:

```shell
lms load <model_key> --identifier "my-custom-identifier"
```

You will then be able to refer to this model by the identifier `my_model` in subsequent commands and API calls (`model` parameter).

### Set context length

You can set the context length when loading a model using the `--context-length` flag:

```shell
lms load <model_key> --context-length 4096
```

This determines how many tokens the model will consider as context when generating text.

### Set GPU offload

Control GPU memory usage with the `--gpu` flag:

```shell
lms load <model_key> --gpu 0.5    # Offload 50% of layers to GPU
lms load <model_key> --gpu max    # Offload all layers to GPU
lms load <model_key> --gpu off    # Disable GPU offloading
```

If not specified, LM Studio will automatically determine optimal GPU usage.

### Set TTL

Set an auto-unload timer with the `--ttl` flag (in seconds):

```shell
lms load <model_key> --ttl 3600   # Unload after 1 hour of inactivity
```

## Operate on a remote LM Studio instance

`lms load` supports the `--host` flag to connect to a remote LM Studio instance. 

```shell
lms load <model_key> --host <host>
```

For this to work, the remote LM Studio instance must be running and accessible from your local machine, e.g. be accessible on the same subnet.

`lms log stream` allows you to inspect the exact input string that goes to the model.

This is particularly useful for debugging prompt template issues and other unexpected LLM behaviors.

<hr>

```lms_protip
If you haven't already, bootstrap `lms` on your machine by following the instructions [here](/docs/cli).
```

### Debug your prompts with `lms log stream`

`lms log stream` allows you to inspect the exact input string that goes to the model.

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
lms log stream
```

This will start streaming logs from LM Studio. Send a message in the Chat UI or send a request to the local server to see the logs.

### Example output

```bash
$ lms log stream

index: 9
---

The `lms push` command packages the contents of the current directory and uploads
it to the LM Studio Hub. You can use it to share presets, plugins, or
[`model.yaml`](http://modelyaml.org) files.

### Parameters
```lms_params
- name: "--overrides"
  type: "string"
  optional: true
  description: "A JSON string of values to override in the manifest or metadata"
- name: "--write-revision"
  type: "flag"
  optional: true
  description: "Write the returned revision number to `manifest.json`"
```

## Upload a Plugin, Preset, or `model.yaml`

Run `lms push` inside the directory that contains your plugin, preset, or `model.yaml` file:

1. Navigate to the directory of your plugin, preset, or `model.yaml` file:
```shell
cd path/to/your/directory
```
2. Run the command:
```shell
lms push
```

The command uploads the artifact and prints the revision number. When used with
`--write-revision`, the revision number is also written to the `manifest.json`
file so you can track revisions in version control.

This command works for [presets](/docs/app/presets),
[plugins](/docs/typescript/plugins), and `model.yaml` files.

### Example Usage with `--overrides`
You can use the `--overrides` parameter to modify the metadata before pushing:

```shell
lms push --overrides '{"description": "new-description"}'
```

The `lms server stop` command gracefully stops the running LM Studio server.

## Stop the server

Stop the running server instance:

```shell
lms server stop
```

Example output:
```
Stopped the server on port 1234.
```

Any active request will be terminated when the server is stopped. You can restart the server using [`lms server start`](/docs/cli/server-start).

The `lms unload` command unloads a model from memory. You can optionally specify a model key to unload a specific model, or use the `--all` flag to unload all models.

## Parameters
```lms_params
- name: "[model_key]"
  type: "string"
  optional: true
  description: "The key of the model to unload. If not provided, you will be prompted to select one"
- name: "--all"
  type: "flag"
  optional: true
  description: "Unload all currently loaded models"
- name: "--host"
  type: "string"
  optional: true
  description: "The host address of a remote LM Studio instance to connect to"
```

## Unload a specific model

Unload a single model from memory by running:

```shell
lms unload <model_key>
```

If no model key is provided, you will be prompted to select from currently loaded models.

## Unload all models

To unload all currently loaded models at once:

```shell
lms unload --all
```

## Operate on a remote LM Studio instance

`lms unload` supports the `--host` flag to connect to a remote LM Studio instance:

```shell
lms unload <model_key> --host <host>
```

For this to work, the remote LM Studio instance must be running and accessible from your local machine, e.g. be accessible on the same subnet.
