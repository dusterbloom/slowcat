# üö® MCP Integration Debug Status

## Current Status: NOT WORKING

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- **Auto-discovery**: 25 MCP tools discovered from 3 servers via JSON-RPC stdio
- **MCP servers**: All servers working when called directly 
- **Tool schema**: 42 tools (17 local + 25 MCP) included in LM Studio request
- **Local tools**: Calculate, music control, etc. working perfectly
- **File paths**: Fixed absolute path issue for memory server

### What's NOT Working ‚ùå
- **LM Studio MCP execution**: LM Studio sees tools but doesn't call them
- **Memory search**: LM Studio responds with "I don't have information" instead of calling search_nodes
- **Native MCP integration**: LM Studio is not using mcp.json configuration

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that **LM Studio is not properly configured to use MCP servers**.

### Evidence:
1. **No tool calls in logs**: LM Studio doesn't call any MCP tools (search_nodes, etc.)
2. **Text-only response**: Instead of calling tools, LM Studio just says "I don't have information"
3. **MCP servers unused**: Our working MCP servers are never contacted by LM Studio

### Hypothesis:
LM Studio v0.3.22 has MCP support, but it needs to be **explicitly configured** to use our mcp.json file.

## Possible Solutions:

### 1. LM Studio Configuration
- LM Studio might need to be configured to enable MCP integration
- Check LM Studio settings/preferences for MCP options
- Verify LM Studio is reading mcp.json from correct location

### 2. Environment Variables
- LM Studio might need specific environment variables to find MCP config
- Try setting MCP_CONFIG_PATH or similar

### 3. LM Studio Restart
- LM Studio might need restart after mcp.json creation/modification
- MCP configuration might only load on startup

### 4. Working Directory
- LM Studio might need to be started from directory containing mcp.json
- Try starting LM Studio from /Users/peppi/Dev/macos-local-voice-agents/server/

## Next Steps:
1. Research LM Studio v0.3.22 MCP configuration requirements
2. Check if LM Studio needs specific settings to enable MCP
3. Verify LM Studio is actually loading mcp.json configuration
4. Test if LM Studio shows MCP tools in its interface when properly configured

## Architecture Note:
The auto-discovery system is working perfectly. The issue is not with our code - it's with getting LM Studio to actually use the MCP servers we've configured.
