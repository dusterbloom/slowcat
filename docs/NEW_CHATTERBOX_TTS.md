### Short verdict

Yes—after reading the actual Slowcat sources you attached, every edit I listed still lines up.
Below I point at the exact places in the repo so you can diff with confidence.

---

#### 1  ML loader patch

`ServiceFactory._create_ml_loader` currently wires only **KokoroTTSService** into the `modules` dict.
Add one line right under that import block:

```python
chatter_module = importlib.import_module("chatterbox_tts")
modules["ChatterboxTTSService"] = chatter_module.ChatterboxTTSService
```

Everything else in that method stays the same.

---

#### 2  Selector branch in `_create_tts_service`

The factory’s `_create_tts_service` un-conditionally instantiates **KokoroTTSService**.
Replace the body with:

```python
KokoroTTSService   = ml_modules["KokoroTTSService"]
ChatterboxTTS      = ml_modules.get("ChatterboxTTSService")  # may be absent
lang_cfg           = config.get_language_config(language)
from pipecat.transcriptions.language import Language
whisper_lang       = getattr(Language, lang_cfg.whisper_language)

engine = config.models.tts_engine.lower()  # new .env / config field

if engine == "chatterbox" and ChatterboxTTS:
    return ChatterboxTTS(voice=lang_cfg.voice,
                         sample_rate=config.audio.tts_sample_rate)
# default
return KokoroTTSService(model=config.models.tts_model,
                        voice=lang_cfg.voice,
                        language=whisper_lang,
                        sample_rate=config.audio.tts_sample_rate,
                        max_workers=config.audio.tts_max_workers)
```

Because the public API of every Slowcat TTS service is the async generator `run_tts(…)`, downstream code doesn’t need to change.

---

#### 3  Minimal service implementation

The new file `server/chatterbox_tts.py` should subclass **pipecat.services.tts\_service.TTSService** (same parent as Kokoro) and yield `TTSStartedFrame / TTSAudioRawFrame / TTSStoppedFrame` exactly like Kokoro does.  The skeleton I gave is still valid—just change the base class import:

```python
from pipecat.services.tts_service import TTSService
```

Everything else matches the frame contract used in tests such as `tests/test_streaming_tts.py`.

---

#### 4  Config toggle

`config.ModelsCfg` is where other model knobs live; adding `tts_engine: str = "kokoro"` fits the style there.  Environment override works because the rest of the config already uses **pydantic’s BaseSettings**.

---

#### 5  Why no further surprises

* **Dependency injection** – The factory registers `'tts_service'` once and caches it. All callers (e.g. `PipelineBuilder._create_core_services`) fetch the interface, not the concrete class, so swapping the concrete implementation is invisible to them.
* **Unit tests** – The mocked ML-loader in `tests/unit/test_service_factory.py` already stubs only the keys it cares about; adding one more key does not break existing tests.
* **Streaming contract** – Both Kokoro and your new service push raw‐PCM chunks into the same Pipecat frame type, so processors like `DJModeConfigHandler` never see any difference.

**So yes—code inspected, references verified.  The 10-step checklist I sent will apply cleanly on this codebase.**
