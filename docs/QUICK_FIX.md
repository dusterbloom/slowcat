# Quick Fix for Voice Recognition

## What I Did

1. **Lowered thresholds** to match your voice characteristics:
   - `confidence_threshold`: 0.45 (was 0.85)
   - `min_consistency_threshold`: 0.40 (was 0.70)

2. **Removed bad profile** - The Speaker_1 profile only had 1 fingerprint

## What You Need to Do

1. **Restart the bot**:
   ```bash
   ./run_bot.sh
   ```

2. **Speak normally** for 3-5 utterances to re-enroll

3. **Watch the logs** for:
   - "Unknown speaker detected. Starting enrollment session."
   - "Collected X consistent utterances"
   - "Magic! Auto-enrolled new speaker"

## Alternative Solution

If voice recognition still doesn't work, we can force all conversations to use a specific speaker ID:

```python
# In bot.py, after creating memory_processor:
memory_processor.user_id = "Speaker_1"  # Force specific user
```

## Why This Is Happening

1. **Audio quality** - The fingerprints show 41% zeros
2. **Microphone issues** - Possible audio processing problems
3. **Resemblyzer model** - May need different preprocessing

## Temporary Workaround

Until voice recognition works, you can:
1. Use the default_user for all conversations
2. The memory search will still work with default_user
3. Just ask the bot to "search conversations for X"
