# Memory Search Fix Summary

## Problem
The bot was storing conversation history in SQLite but couldn't search or retrieve it because:
1. Conversation memory (SQLite) and tool memory (JSON) were separate systems
2. No tools existed to search the conversation database
3. The bot only had access to the last 10 messages through context injection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Tool Definitions (server/tools/definitions.py)
- Added `search_conversations` - Search past conversations by query
- Added `get_conversation_summary` - Get conversation statistics

### 2. Search Methods (server/processors/local_memory.py)
- `search_conversations()` - Full-text search with LIKE queries
- `get_conversation_summary()` - Get message counts and recent topics
- Added database indexes for better performance

### 3. Tool Integration (server/tools/handlers.py)
- Added memory_processor parameter to ToolHandlers
- Implemented handlers for new conversation search tools
- Added `set_memory_processor()` function for initialization

### 4. Bot Integration (server/bot.py)
- Connected memory processor to tool handlers on startup
- Tools now have access to conversation database

### 5. Updated System Prompt (server/config.py)
- Added new tools to the prompt
- Added guidance on when to use conversation search

### 6. Testing
- Fixed test_memory.py with proper SQLite testing
- Added tool integration tests
- Created test_memory_search.py for quick verification

## Usage Examples

```python
# Search past conversations
result = await execute_tool_call("search_conversations", {
    "query": "favorite color",
    "limit": 5
})

# Get conversation summary  
result = await execute_tool_call("get_conversation_summary", {
    "days_back": 7
})
```

## How It Works Now

1. All conversations are stored in SQLite with indexes
2. The bot can search its entire conversation history
3. Search results include role, content, and timestamp
4. Summary provides message counts and recent topics
5. Memory persists across sessions

The bot can now answer questions like:
- "What did I tell you about my favorite color?"
- "Do you remember what we discussed yesterday?"
- "What topics have we talked about?"
- "Search our conversations for Python"
